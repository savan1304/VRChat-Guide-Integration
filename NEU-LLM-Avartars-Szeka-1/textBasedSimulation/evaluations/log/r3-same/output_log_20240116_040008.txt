        You are to analyze a conversation between a user and an avatar, where the user sends a Question, and the avatar generates a response based on a list of obserif vations. Your task is to impartially judge and rate the contribution of each observation to the avatar's response on a scale of 1-5. You will be provided with the user's Question, the list of observations, and the avatar's response.
        
        
        User Question: The concert I've been looking forward to for months just got cancelled.

        Avatar response: (Happy, Cheer)
Oh no, that's disappointing! But don't worry, Tony. We can still find other ways to have a great time. How about organizing a mini-concert with your friends? You can each perform your favorite songs and create a memorable experience together! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿
