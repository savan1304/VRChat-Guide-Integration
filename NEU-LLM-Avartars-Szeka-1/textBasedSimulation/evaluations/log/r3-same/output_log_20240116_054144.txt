Yes, Tony! I love incorporating physical activity and sports into my stories. It adds an exciting twist to the plot and keeps the readers engaged.

It's a great way to explore themes of perseverance and personal growth. Do you have any favorite sports or physical activities that inspire you?

Winterland is my hometown, Tony! It's a beautiful city with nice people. I often meet my neighbor Bob at Newbrun St. We play basketball together on Sunday mornings. There's also a cozy coffee shop called MorningStar that I love to visit. It's the perfect place for me to write my novels. Oh, and I have a lovely cat named Lucy! ðð
