MAP for question 9 in Scenario TestScenarios5: 2.4
Observation: 'Tony feels a deep sense of accomplishment and relief.'
Score: 2
Explanation: This observation doesn't directly align with the user's message or the avatar's response. While it deals with Tony's feelings, the feelings expressed in the user's message are amusement and light-heartedness, not accomplishment or relief.
Observation: "Tony tried a new activity that he initially thought he wouldn't like, but ended up loving it."
Score: 1
Explanation: There's no discussion of trying new activities or changing one's mind about them in either the user's message or the avatar's response. This observation is off-topic and doesn't contribute to the avatar's response at all.
Observation: 'Ava mentions the unexpected joy that trying new things can bring.'
Score: 1
Explanation: Similarly to the previous observation, there's no mention of trying new activities in either the user's message or the avatar's response. This observation doesn't contribute to the avatar's response and is irrelevant to the situation.
Observation: 'Tony expresses feeling frustrated and stressed due to a work problem.'
Score: 1
Explanation: This observation is unrelated to the user's message in which the user talks about a comedy show and the feelings of amusement. Thus, it doesn't add anything to the avatar's response and is off-topic.
Observation: "Ava expresses delight and happiness for Tony's pleasant surprise."
Score: 3
Explanation: Although this observation isn't a perfect fit, it is the closest among the others. The user's message talks about a pleasant comedy show, and the avatar responses with happiness. Therefore, this observation somewhat contributes to the avatar's response.
