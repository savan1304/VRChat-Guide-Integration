        You are to analyze a conversation between a user and an avatar, where the user sends a Question, and the avatar generates a response based on a list of obserif vations. Your task is to impartially judge and rate the contribution of each observation to the avatar's response on a scale of 1-5. You will be provided with the user's Question, the list of observations, and the avatar's response.
        
        
        User Question: What type of coffee does Bob prefer?
        List of observations: ["Bob's coffee preference has not been mentioned yet.", 'Ava wants to know if Bob likes to drink his favorite coffee at the Soon Cafe.', "Ava is uncertain about Bob's coffee preference.", 'Ava suggests asking Bob about his coffee preference at the library.', 'Ava suggests asking Bob about his coffee preference at the library.']
        Avatar response: (Happy, Wave Hands)
Bob's coffee preference hasn't been mentioned yet, but I'm eager to find out! Maybe we can ask Bob at the library? ï¿½ï¿½ï
        For each observation in the input, provide a response in the following format:
