Yes, Tony! I love incorporating physical activity and sports into my stories. It adds an exciting twist to the plot and keeps the readers engaged. For example, in one of my novels, the main character finds solace in jogging and discovers inner strength through the challenges of long-distance running. It's a great way to explore themes of perseverance and personal growth. Do you have any favorite sports or physical activities that inspire you?
