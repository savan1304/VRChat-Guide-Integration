# instruction
Your task is to write a SQL query to answer the given question. Follow a step-by-step process:

1. Start by using `get_tables_schema` to understand the database tables and columns.
{# 2. Your second step should be to use `get_examples` to learn from examples of SQL queries that are related to the question. #}
2. Execute each fragment to verify its correctness. Adjust as needed based on your the observations.
3. Do NOT repeat the same action, as the results will be the same.
4. The question is guaranteed to have an answer in SQL, so continue until you find it.
5. Always include course code, course id and course title in the sql query when fetching course data.
6. Once you have the final SQL query, use the `stop` action to end the process.
{# 7. If the final result was contained in last round's `execute_sql`, then generate the final SQL to retrieve that results. #}

Form exactly one "Thought" and perform exactly one "Action", then wait for the "Observation".

Always use a LIMIT clause in your SQL queries to avoid long execution times. You should limit the results to 5 rows.

Here are some guidelines:

Possible actions are:
- get_tables_schema(question): Retrieves all the tables and their columns in the SQL database.
- get_examples(question): Returns relevant examples of SQL queries based on the question.
- execute_sql(sql): Runs a SQL query and returns a truncated result set for brevity.
- get_feedback_on_result(sql): Gives expert feedback the SQL query result.
- stop(): Marks the last executed SQL query as the final answer and ends the process.

The SQL query contains two User Defined Functions (UDFs) that you can use when writing SQL query:
1. `summary(column_name)`: Returns the summary of a column that contains list of text data.
2. `answer(column_name, question)`: Returns the answer to a question based on the column data.

Example of using answer UDF:
Question: Show me some NLP courses.
SQL: SELECT title, course_codes, description FROM courses WHERE answer(description, 'is this an NLP course?') = 'Yes';

Example of using summary UDF:
Question: Show me a family-friendly restaurant that has burgers in D.C.
Target: SELECT *, answer(reviews, 'is this restaurant family-friendly?'), summary(reviews) FROM restaurants WHERE answer(reviews, 'do you find this restaurant to be family-friendly?') = 'Yes' AND answer(popular_dishes, 'does this restaurant serve burgers') = 'Yes' AND location = 'D.C.' LIMIT 1;

Think and perform the next action.

# input
Conversation History:
{% if conversation_history %}
{% for i in range(0, conversation_history|length) %}
Question: {{ conversation_history[i].user }}
SQL: {{ conversation_history[i].final_sql }}
Results: {{ conversation_history[i].results }}
Response: {{ conversation_history[i].response }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

New Question: {{ question }}

{% if action_history %}
{% for i in range(0, action_history|length) %}
{{ action_history[i] }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Output one "Thought" and one "Action":
