    Framework for creating reliable conversational agents
</p>


Genie is a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational
agents that are designed to handle complex user interactions and knowledge
access. Unlike LLMs, Genie provides reliable grounded responses, with 
controllable agent policies through its expressive specification, Genie 
Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it is resilient to diverse user queries,
helpful with knowledge sources, and offers ease of programming policies through
 its declarative paradigm.

## Installation

To install Genie, we recommend using uv ([UV installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))


```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/worksheets.git
cd worksheets
uv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

## Creating Agents

Example agents are present in `experiments/agents/` directory. You can use them
as a reference to create your own agents.

### Define your Knowledge Sources

```python
from worksheets.knowledge import SUQLKnowledgeBase

suql_knowledge = SUQLKnowledgeBase(
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o", # model name
    tables_with_primary_keys={
        "restaurants": "_id", # table name and primary key
    },
    database_name="restaurants", # database name
    embedding_server_address="http://127.0.0.1:8509",  # embedding server address for free text
    source_file_mapping={
        "course_assistant_general_info.txt": os.path.join(
            current_dir, "course_assistant_general_info.txt"
        ) # mapping of free-text files with the path
    },
    postprocessing_fn=postprocess_suql,  # optional postprocessing function
    result_postprocessing_fn=None,  # optional result postprocessing function
)
```

### Define your Knowledge Parser

1. REACT Multi-agent parser

```python
from worksheets.knowledge import SUQLReActParser

suql_react_parser = SUQLReActParser(
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o",  # model name
    example_path=os.path.join(current_dir, "examples.txt"),  # path to examples
    instruction_path=os.path.join(current_dir, "instructions.txt"),  # path to domain-specific instructions
    table_schema_path=os.path.join(current_dir, "table_schema.txt"),  # path to table schema
    knowledge=suql_knowledge,  # previously defined knowledge source
)
```

2. Simple LLM Parser

```python
from worksheets.knowledge import SUQLParser

suql_parser = SUQLParser(
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o",
    prompt_selector=None,  # optional function that helps in selecting the right prompt
    knowledge=suql_knowledge,
),
```

### Define the Agent

```python
from worksheets.agent import Agent
course_assistant_bot = Agent(
    botname="YelpBot",
    description="You an assistant at Yelp and help users with all their queries related to booking a restaurant. You can search for restaurants, ask me anything about the restaurant and book a table.",
    prompt_dir=prompt_dir,  # directory for prompts
    starting_prompt="""Hello! I'm YelpBot. I'm here to help you find and book restaurants in four bay area cities **San Francisco, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, and Cupertino**. What would you like to do?""",
    args={},  # additional arguments
    api=[book_restaurant_yelp],  # optional API functions
    knowledge_base=suql_knowledge,  # previously defined knowledge source
    knowledge_parser=suql_parser,  # previously defined knowledge parser
).load_from_gsheet(gsheet_id="ADD YOUR SPREADSHEET ID HERE",)
```


### Run the conversation loop

```python
from asyncio import run
from worksheets.interface_utils import conversation_loop

asyncio.run(conversation_loop(course_assistant_bot, output_state_path="yelp_bot.json"))
```


### Add prompts
For each agent you need to create prompts for:
- Semantic parsing: `semantic_parsing.prompt`
- Response generation: `response_generator.prompt`

Place these prompts in the prompt directory that you specify while creating the
agent.

You can copy basic annotated prompts from `experiments/sample_prompts/` 
directory. Make change where we have `TODO`. You need two provide a few 
guidelines in the prompt that will help the LLM to perform better and some 
examples. Please `experiments/agents/course_enroll/prompts/` for inspiration!


### Spreadsheet Specification

To create a new agent, you should have a Google Service Account and create a new spreadsheet. 
You can follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview) to create a Google Service Account.
Share the created spreadsheet with the service account email.

You should save the service_account key as `service_account.json` in the `worksheets/` directory.

Here is a starter worksheet that you can use for your reference: [Starter Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ST1ixBogjEEzEhMeb-kVyf-JxGRMjtlRR6z4G2sjyb4/edit?usp=sharing)

Here is a sample spreadsheet for a restaurant agent: [Restaurant Agent](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FXg5VFrdxQlUyld3QmKKL9BN1lLIhAtQTJjCHyNOU_Y/edit?usp=sharing)

Please note that we only use the specification defined in the first sheet of the spreadsheet.

### Running the Agent (Web Interface)

Create a folder `frontend/`  under `experiments/agents/<agent_name>` and create a `app_*` file.

You can run the agent in a web interface by running:

**NOTE:** You should run the agent in the `frontend` directory to preserve the frontend assets.

For restaurant agent:
```bash
cd experiments/agents/yelpbot/frontend/
chainlit run app_restaurant.py --port 8800
```

## Set LLM Config
```
export AZURE_OPENAI_WS_KEY="<AZURE OPENAI WS KEY>"
export AZURE_WS_ENDPOINT="<AZURE WS ENDPOINT>"
export AZURE_WS_API_VERSION="<AZURE WS API VERSION>"
```
