[{"user": "What are some courses on natural language processing?", "bot": "I searched for courses on natural language processing and found the following options:\n\n1. **Human Centered NLP**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 129X, CS 329X\n   - **Description**: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), especially around large pretrained models, have enabled extensive successful applications. However, there are growing concerns about the negative aspects of NLP systems, such as biases and a lack of input from users. This course gives an overview of human-centered techniques and applications for NLP, ranging from human-centered design thinking to human-in-the-loop algorithms, fairness, and accessibility. Along the way, we will cover machine-learning techniques which are especially relevant to NLP and to human experiences. Prerequisite: CS224N or CS224U, or equivalent background in natural language processing.\n\n2. **Spoken Language Processing**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 224S, LINGUIST 285\n   - **Description**: Introduction to spoken language technology with an emphasis on dialogue and conversational systems. Deep learning and other methods for automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, affect detection, dialogue management, and applications to digital assistants and spoken language understanding systems. Prerequisites: CS124, CS221, CS224N, or CS229.\n\n3. **Conversational Virtual Assistants with Deep Learning**\n   - **Course Code**: CS 224V\n   - **Description**: Generative AI, and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), has already changed how we work and study. But this is just the beginning, as it has the potential of assisting and perhaps eventually automating knowledge workers in all areas, from law, medicine, to teaching and mental health therapists. This course will focus on the general principles and the latest research on methodologies and tools that can be applied to all domains. This is a project-oriented course, where students will gain hands-on experience in either methodology research or applying the concepts to create useful assistants for a domain of their choice. Topics include: (1) growing LLMs' knowledge through a combination of manual supervised learning and self-learning, (2) stopping LLMs from hallucination by grounding them with external corpora of knowledge, which is necessary for handling new, live, private as well as long-tail data, (3) handling external data corpora in different domains including structured and unstructured data, (4) experimentation and evaluation of conversational assistants based on LLMs, (5) controlling LLMs to achieve tasks, (6) persuasive LLMs, (7) multilingual assistants, and (8) combining voice and graphical interfaces. Prerequisites: one of LINGUIST 180/280, CS 124, CS 224N, CS 224S, 224U.\n\n4. **Seminar on Ethical and Social Issues in Natural Language Processing**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 384, LINGUIST 287\n   - **Description**: Seminar covering issues in natural language processing related to ethical and social issues and the overall impact of these algorithms on people and society. Topics include: bias in data and models, privacy and computational profiling, measuring civility and toxicity online, computational propaganda, manipulation and framing, fairness/equity, power, recommendations and filter bubbles, applications to social good, and philosophical foundations of ethical investigation. Prerequisites: CS 224N and 224U.\n\n5. **Race and Natural Language Processing**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 329R, LINGUIST 281A, PSYCH 257A\n   - **Description**: The goal of this practicum is to integrate methods from natural language processing with social psychological perspectives on race to build practical systems that address significant societal issues. Readings will be drawn broadly from across the social sciences and computer science. Students will work with large, complex datasets and participate in research involving community partnerships relevant to race and natural language processing. Prerequisite: CS224N, PSYCH290, or equivalent background in natural language processing. Students interested in participating should complete the online application for permission at https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs329r/.
