[{"user": "Show me a few courses on natural language procrssing", "bot": "I searched for courses on natural language processing and here are a few options available:\n\n1. **Human Centered NLP**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 129X, CS 329X\n   - **Description**: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), especially around large pretrained models, have enabled extensive successful applications. However, there are growing concerns about the negative aspects of NLP systems, such as biases and a lack of input from users. This course gives an overview of human-centered techniques and applications for NLP, ranging from human-centered design thinking to human-in-the-loop algorithms, fairness, and accessibility. Along the way, we will cover machine-learning techniques which are especially relevant to NLP and to human experiences. Prerequisite: CS224N or CS224U, or equivalent background in natural language processing.\n\n2. **Spoken Language Processing**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 224S, LINGUIST 285\n   - **Description**: Introduction to spoken language technology with an emphasis on dialogue and conversational systems. Deep learning and other methods for automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, affect detection, dialogue management, and applications to digital assistants and spoken language understanding systems. Prerequisites: CS124, CS221, CS224N, or CS229.\n\n3. **NLP for Computational Social Science**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 224C\n   - **Description**: We live in an era where many aspects of our social interactions are recorded as textual data, from social media posts to medical and financial records. This course is about using a variety of techniques from machine learning and theories from social science to study human behaviors and important societal questions at scale. Topics will include methods for natural language processing and causal inference, and their applications to important societal questions around hate speech, misinformation, and social movements.\n\n4. **Conversational Virtual Assistants with Deep Learning**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 224V\n   - **Description**: Generative AI, and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), has already changed how we work and study. This course will focus on the general principles and the latest research on methodologies and tools that can be applied to all domains. This is a project-oriented course, where students will gain hands-on experience in either methodology research or applying the concepts to create useful assistants for a domain of their choice. Topics include growing LLMs' knowledge, stopping LLMs from hallucination, handling external data corpora, experimentation and evaluation of conversational assistants, controlling LLMs to achieve tasks, persuasive LLMs, multilingual assistants, and combining voice and graphical interfaces. Prerequisites: one of LINGUIST 180/280, CS 124, CS 224N, CS 224S, 224U.\n\n5. **Seminar on Ethical and Social Issues in Natural Language Processing**\n   - **Course Codes**: CS 384, LINGUIST 287\n   - **Description**: Seminar covering issues in natural language processing related to ethical and social issues and the overall impact of these algorithms on people and society. Topics include bias in data and models, privacy and computational profiling, measuring civility and toxicity online, computational propaganda, manipulation and framing, fairness/equity, power, recommendations and filter bubbles, applications to social good, and philosophical foundations of ethical investigation.
