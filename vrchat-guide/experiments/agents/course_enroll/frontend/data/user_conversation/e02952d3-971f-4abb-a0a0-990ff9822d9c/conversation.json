Ron really knows his stuff as do the TAs.\", 'The course is ambitious in the scope of topics covered, which often results in material being discussed too rapidly to fully understand it or link it to other concepts. With some refinement however, it could be an extremely valuable primer in the basic mathematics underpinning ML.', 'Good survey of practical methods, you get out what you put in', \"when I took this class it seemed super manageable at first but then people complained it was too easy so week 4 (after the drop deadline I would like to point out) the staff made the homework WAY harder to the point where I couldn't do/understand anything. From that point on I got literally nothing out of the course because it was way too hard for me. I'm just upset because I don't think it's fair to completely change the level of difficulty of a class after the drop deadline. If I knew the class was going to be what they made it but instead on day 1 I would've been fine with it and just accepted it wasn't the course for me and dropped it. unfortunately they didn't give people like me that opportunity.  Besides that, ron's teaching method is reading from typed course notes. There are no examples just formulas/random notes about matrix sizes/rank/etc. I do not learn when I am just read a formula and don't actually see it used.\", 'Look for typos and go to OH for clarifications', 'Mostly written math, little coding'], 'start_year': 2018, 'end_year': 2019, 'season': 'winter'}, {'reviews': ['Ron is a great instructor. He explains stuff clearly and intuitively with simple yet illustrative examples. The written homework is reasonable and overall straightforward. The quiz is made very friendly. If you decide to do the optional programming assignment, it is independent from lectures but provides a decent amount of intro to someone who does not have experience with applied machine learning methods. Overall the course quality is great and it is obvious contents are developed and organized well from the teaching team year by year.', \"Ron is a great math teacher with lots of insightful comments during lecture as someone who has been in the field of ML for quite some time and can also critique it from a more theoretical POV (so really watch/attend lecture if possible). Some reviews will tell you that you can get by with just clicking through slides, which is mostly true, but is that what you're here for? nnNo exams, no meaningless group projects. Just a 5-min quiz session and a homework every week. And Ron likes to give out A's. nnThe quiz sessions are very straightfoward and to me at least was very helpful as it motivated me to take a second & slightly deeper review of the content for the week. This takes like max 30 mins a week to prep for. Homeworks are a little harder and definitely make you think, but with enough mulling they're all within reach. You might need to pop into office hours a few times, but the TAs are super responsive and helpful, so you'll get your HW done without major struggles.nnOverall, Ron has polished this class to a gem over the years. Some take it before other ML classes as prep, some like me took ML in undergrad and still find a lot of useful insight & mathematical details in Ron's class. My 2 cents is that this class is probably best appreciated after some ML exposure so that Ron's extra comments make more sense & you mostly get why he digs into some of these details that would otherwise feel pedantic as a general applied math class. But in terms of knowledge, general understanding of linalg is sufficient.nnChill enough that I'd recommend other PhD students take this too.\", 'Great course for understanding optimization and fundamentals of linear algebra for ML.', 'Awesome', \"It can be a tough class at times, especially if you don't have the background knowledge, however, it is still a really good class with really good TAs to help you.\", \"Course was a lot more manageable than I anticipated, the (low stakes) weekly quiz format helped me focus on learning and making sure I understood how every week's concepts was built on from the previous. Ron's teaching style was very clear and straightforward, contrary to what previous reviews have said, and honestly one of the most interesting compared to other LA/optimization classes as he connects theory to applications very well. Problem sets are very doable if you understand lecture. Kevin, Yongxu and Dalton were very helpful TAs. However, the programming assignment instructions were poor and often I was just guessing what I was supposed to do, but those are optional.\", \"Lectures are great, with a focus on intuition and understanding the current state of ML with regards to the course material. Ron manages to include a lot of commentary without detracting from the clarity of the lectures. Often, this commentary links past work in simulation and optimization to ML, and helps demisitify ML terminology. The lectures are very thoughtful and solid, and Ron's math background shows even though the course is not taught at the pure math level. I really like the weekly quiz format and pick-and-choose homeworks. The homework is pen-and-paper, usually a combination of proving things about methods and carrying out small pen-and-paper implementations. Sometimes the homework feels like it is more geared to working the proof/math part of your brain than reinforcing lecture topics, which has its good and bad. You will not leave this course ready to code up any of the methods, but you will know where to start. Ron mostly wants to get across an understanding of these methods so people know what is going on under the hood of the code bases they use and understand the limitations.nnI did 5/9 of the programming assignments. These first five were mainly an introduction to tensorflow, which was helpful but completely disconnected from the rest of the class. Worth doing these if you have time, but they will rarely give any benefit to your grade.\", 'Ron is very knowledgeable about the material and incorporates his background in research into the lectures', 'This course is a must.', 'This class does a great job of introducing difficult mathematical concepts that are needed to get started on researching topics related to machine learning. Homeworks follow course topics pretty well and lectures are useful and engaging.', \"I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT! I did not really learn anything in the class.\", 'The course is very well-organized and I feel satisfied with the knowledge I took away. It is not stressful at all and the unit count accurately reflects the weekly time commitment. Fedkiw is a good lecturer!', \"This class was definitely challenging, especially if you didn't have much experience with linear algebra. The problem sets were pretty difficult but the quizzes were reasonable (though this was during COVID where they released the quiz questions beforehand and a CA would just ask you one of the questions on the quiz day). The only thing I didn't really like about this class were the programming assignments since they were extremely confusing. But if you want to improve your linear algebra skills, I would say take the class. Ron's also an amazing lecturer!\", 'If you are interested in linear algebra, optimization, and/or machine learning, definitely take it! Never in my life had I found myself saying the PSets were a ton of fun, but these were!', 'A good class, I learned a lot. Seems like a super solid choice to take before 229, and is a good step up from math 51 (which I took years ago). TAs and Ron are nice and always helpful. It can be easy to fall behind in lecture/hw so avoid doing that before you are too far behind to catch up', 'A great class to learn math foundations for machine learning (linear algebra and optimization). I wish I could take this class before taking CS230. In CS230, I can have a high-level understanding of concepts like Gradient Descent, Adam, and Regularization. However, after this class, I can now understand the mathematical details behind those concepts. For example: Why gradient descent only needs the Jacobean matrix. Why adaptive learning rate methods ( Momentum and Adam) work better on optimization problems. Why we want to add \"Ic = 0\" to the system for regularization. I feel more confident to take more advanced machine learning classes now.nnThe homework is hard, but you will truly understand the things talked on the lectures after you finish them. I like the weekly quizzes best. Those quizzes forced you to pay attention to every part of the lectures. Answering them makes sure you understand some of the key concepts.nnI can feel Ron is passionate about this class, and he is good at explaining math concepts clearly. All the TAs are friendly and patient, so please utilize the office hour if you are stuck on the homework.', 'As someone who has taken a number of linear algebra courses, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of new things I learned in this class.
