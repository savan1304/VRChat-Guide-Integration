Here are some options:\n\n1. **Course Title:** Hap.py Code: The Python Programming Language\n   - **Course Code(s):** CS 41\n   - **Description:** This course is about the fundamentals and contemporary usage of the Python programming language. The primary focus is on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the Python language. Topics include: Pythonic conventions, data structures such as list comprehensions, anonymous functions, iterables, powerful built-ins (e.g. map, filter, zip), and Python libraries. For the last few weeks, students will work with course staff to develop their own significant Python project. Prerequisite: CS106B, CS106X, or equivalent.\n\n2. **Course Title:** Selected Reading of Ph.D. Dissertations\n   - **Course Code(s):** CS 349G\n   - **Description:** Detailed reading of 5 selected Ph.D. dissertations within a field of computer science. For undergraduates, the course is an introduction to advanced foundational concepts within a field as well as an in-depth look at detailed research. For graduate students, the course focuses on historical reading as well as an opportunity to read dissertations and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Both groups of students discuss historical context, how ideas succeeded or did not and why, and how they manifest in modern technology. The discussion of each dissertation completes with a guest lecture by its author. The selected dissertations change with each offering but are always from a coherent time period and topic area. Prerequisites: CS110 for undergraduates, EE282 for graduate students.\n\n3. **Course Title:** Part-time Curricular Practical Training\n   - **Course Code(s):** CS 390D\n   - **Description:** For qualified computer science PhD students only. Permission number required for enrollment; see the CS PhD program administrator in Gates room 195. Educational opportunities in high technology research and development labs in the computing industry. Qualified computer science PhD students engage in research and integrate that work into their academic program. Students register under their faculty advisor during the quarter they are employed and complete a research report outlining their work activity, problems investigated, results, and follow-on projects they expect to perform.

Additional problem solving practice for CS103. In-class participation required. Prerequisite: consent of instructor. Co-requisite: CS103.\n\n5. **Course Title:** Introduction to Essential Software Systems and Tools\n   - **Course Code(s):** CS 104\n   - **Description:** Concepts that are prerequisites to many different CS classes, such as version control, debugging, and basic cryptography and networking, are either left for students to figure out on their own or are taught in \"crash course\" form on-the-fly during other, unrelated classes. We propose to develop a course that will teach students the skills necessary to be successful computer scientists, such as the command line, source code management and debugging, security and cryptography, containers and virtual machines, and cloud computing. In this course, students will both become proficient with practical tools and develop a deeper, intuitive understanding of the involved software systems and computer science concepts. With this deeper understanding, students can leverage critical thinking skills to intelligently and efficiently configure and troubleshoot software systems, assess the security and efficiency of particular tool usages, and synthesize new automation pipelines that integrate multiple tools. To summarize, instead of having just a cursory understanding of how to use these tools, students will learn how to most effectively use these tools to become proficient programmers and computer scientists. In addition, this course can provide a gentle introduction to potentially challenging computer science concepts (e.g., networking) that become a focus in subsequent courses and also help motivate some of the tool usages they will see later in the degree program.\n\nLet me know if you would like more information on any of these courses!",
