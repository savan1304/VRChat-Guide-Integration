[{"user": "How is CS224V?", "bot": "I checked how CS224V is rated. Here are some insights:\n\n- **Review 1:**\n  - Average Rating: 3.4\n  - Number of Ratings: 11\n  - Summary: The course on conversational virtual agents at Stanford received several reviews expressing dissatisfaction. Criticisms were made about its misleading title and content, lack of practical learning, and poor organization. Students noted that the course did not cover expected topics like deep learning and NLP, focusing instead on the professor's lab project, Genie. Assignments were seen as disconnected from lectures, leading to student apathy. Despite acknowledging the professor's kindness and the course's potential, the overall sentiment was disappointing. Improvements in structure and content were suggested.\n\n- **Review 2:**\n  - Average Rating: 4.1\n  - Number of Ratings: 19\n  - Summary: This feedback highlights a course focused on virtual assistants and NLP chatbots. Students found the lectures engaging and the material interesting, appreciating the project-oriented approach. Although some assignments had mixed reviews, the final project was enjoyable. The course, recommended for those interested in the subject, benefits from collaboration with the professor and TAs. It is described as seminar-like, allowing autonomy and exploration of research areas.\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?", "turn_context": "answer = answer('How is CS224V?')\nanswer.result = [{'average_rating': 3.4, 'num_ratings': 11, 'summary': \"The document contains a series of reviews about a course on conversational virtual agents at Stanford.
