Topics include cameras and projection models, low-level image processing methods such as filtering and edge detection; mid-level vision topics such as segmentation and clustering; shape reconstruction from stereo, as well as high-level vision tasks such as object recognition, scene recognition, face detection, and human motion categorization. Prerequisites: linear algebra, basic probability, and statistics.\n\n2. **CS 231N**: \"Deep Learning for Computer Vision\"\n   - **Description**: This course is a deep dive into neural-network-based deep learning methods for computer vision. Students will learn to implement, train, and debug their neural networks and gain an understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. Topics include learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks. Prerequisites: Proficiency in Python and knowledge of college calculus, linear algebra, basic probability, and statistics.\n\n3. **CS 231C**: \"Computer Vision and Image Analysis of Art\"\n   - **Description**: This course focuses on the application of image processing, computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics, and AI techniques to problems in the history and interpretation of fine art. Topics include image-based object recognition in abstract art, brushstrokes analysis, and art attribution.
