Through a series of interactive units, students will learn about the inner-workings of computers, from the execution of our programs all the way down to the hardware that runs them. Topics include simple digital circuits, assembly, simple processors, memory systems (Cache, DRAM, Disk), and bonus topics like GPU's. After completing this class, students should have a newfound appreciation for how incredible computational technology is, as well as direction to fantastic classes that delve into some of these topics in more detail, like CS149, EE108, and EE180. Prerequisite: CS106B.\"}, {'course_id': 105858, 'course_codes': ['CS 344'], 'title': 'Topics in Computer Networks', 'description': 'This class could also be called \"Build an Internet Router\": Students work in teams of two to build a fully functioning Internet router, gaining hands-on experience building the hardware and software of a high-performance network system.  Students design the control plane in C on a linux host and design the data plane in the new P4 language on both a software switch and a high-speed hardware switch (e.g., Intel Tofino). For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the other teams by building a small scale datacenter topology. In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router). No Verilog or FPGA programming experience is required.

This course explores the synergy.nStudents will learn from faculty and industry experts how to build faster and fairer financial systems. Topics include network infrastructure: data center fabrics, ultra-low latency trading systems; cloud computing infrastructure: building large-scale risk computation platforms using virtual machines, containers and serverless computing. A particular focus will be on challenges and opportunities presented by cloud-native financial exchanges: the course will provide such an exchange and student groups will write programs for high-frequency and algorithmic trading. Recommended: Knowledge of basic Networking, OS, or Distributed Systems (CS 144, 140, or equivalent), as well as basic EE courses (EE 178) will be useful.'}, {'course_id': 222821, 'course_codes': ['CS 349G'], 'title': 'Selected Reading of Ph.D. Dissertations', 'description': 'Detailed reading of 5 selected Ph.D. dissertations within a field of computer science. For undergraduates, the course is an introduction to advanced foundational concepts within a field as well as an in-depth look at detailed research. For graduate students, the course focuses on historical reading as well as an opportunity to read dissertations and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Both groups of students discuss historical context, how ideas succeeded or did not and why, and how they manifest in modern technology. The discussion of each dissertation completes with a guest lecture by its author. The selected dissertations change with each offering but are always from a coherent time period and topic area.
