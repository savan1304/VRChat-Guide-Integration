I'm so glad a took it, but there were definitely some miserable nights.\", \"CS224W is kind of like communism-everything about it sounds great in the description. But in practice, the outcome is a woeful disaster.  Let's start with the positive. Firstly, Jure Leskovec is a great instructor. As far as professors go, he is an incredibly energetic and clear lecturer and is generally a really kind, friendly, and approachable human being. Furthermore, the TAs were also quite friendly, pretty active on piazza, and most impressively, they were very so on top of grading, with turnaround times of just one or two days!  A lot could be said about the bad aspects of this class, but ultimately it boils down to the whole experience just being frustrating.   Most notable were the PSETS, which were horrible. They each take a lot of time but none of that effort is spent to you gaining anything-it is just busy work. The problems are uninteresting, tedious, and lack any narrative as to why they matter. You could do most of the questions without even having watched lecture because they tested basic skills like being able to plot a chart as opposed to anything interesting.  Despite this ease, why does it take so much time do the PSETS? Because the SNAP python graph library has, without a doubt, the worst designed API I have ever laid eyes on. Here is a fun trivia question: you have a Graph.nodes() and a Graph.GetNodes() method. What do you think each one does? If you can get even a slightly accurate guess without looking at the documentation, you deserve a Nobel prize and tenure at Stanford. Every line you have to write with this library, you will have to constantly look up again and again because there is no intuitive way for you to remember what does what. Other than that, this quarter some of the questions were new so there were some bumps with that. However, this is expected from new questions so I wouldn't count that as a fault of the class.   Miscellaneous other things: 1) The late day policy is kind of dumb if you just need 5 more minutes to finish an assignment. 2) This class really shouldn't have a poster presentation.  3) The exam was impossibly long. 4) Some guest lectures were not great.   My concluding remarks are that this class has potential to be something really cool if the course staff had a morsel of a sense of pedagogy. Here are some actionable things to do that will make the course better: 1) Literally rm -rf the Snap.py library code and rewrite it. Alternatively, make the class use networkx-it's easier to install and use. 2) Hire a TA who has a better sense of pedagogy; specifically how to frame problem sets so they don't feel like a random collection of useless problems. 3) Keep working on the class, I am sure it will get better.  As a closing note, there are some reasons to take any negative course reviews with a grain of salt. Firstly, the class did a massive content overhaul so students experienced churn because of that. This is pretty natural so I wouldn't count that against the class. In addition, the TA's seemed heavily understaffed, so they had to deal with a lot.\", \"jure is a very good lecturer! you learn cool things and it is a different set of knowledge that you would gain from other ai classes. in terms of difficulty it's probably comparable to 221 but i don't think i spent as much time on this as i did in 221. much easier than 229 and much better taught too. so take it it'll be fun i just wish the psets were a lil more effective... also try not to be 10 lectures behind like i was lol\", \"Really interesting material, sometimes the lecture slides are FAR too dense and explanations are not always clear.

A lot of the techniques covered in it are very ad-hoc and not very theoretically justified. I guess that's just machine learning for you in general. Like yeah sure you can define centrality metric X or Y and show how to compute it and when it might work, but what does it really mean? No proofs of anything concrete really, just some fuzzy guesses. Jure is generally a good lecturer, but the guest lecturers are not nearly as clear. Especially the stochastic block model lecture, which was full of unexplained math and was virtually impossible to understand.  I would say the best thing about the class is that Jure's group produces most of the content they teach, so if this is the material you want to learn, there is absolutely no one better in the world to learn it from.\", \"go big or go home on the final project. don't cop out and just describe characteristics of a random network\", 'Class was very well structured!

The low prereqs set people who are newer to the field up for failure, or at least, a very hard chance at catching up to more experienced grad students. My other major complaint with the class is that the instructors may not put as much effort into creating assignments and providing feedback on projects as other classes do. As an example, one of the questions on the PSETs was implementing some novel ML graph-based models, and the starter code explicitly didn't work; I went to office hours 3 times within the first few days and was told that the TAs didn't know how to do the question either.

The course was recently redone to include more Graph Neural Network material and the incorporation has been rocky. The GNN homework was poorly written and the teaching team had to re-release a new version of the starter code. Despite being provided no other practice problems on GNNs, they composed a substantial portion of the final exam. Further, there were other organizational mishaps. For example, the TAs withheld the answers to the practice exams, encouraging us to come up with them collaboratively on a Google doc, then mysteriously released the answers two days before the test. The exam itself was intentionally made longer than the allotted two hour time span, which seemed unnecessary. I found it to be of comparable difficulty to other AI exams though. Homework difficulty was highly variable. Some problems were trivially easy while others were nigh impossible without scrolling through Piazza for clues or going to office hours, which tended to be overcrowded. To their credit, TAs were responsive to student feedback about matters such as releasing solutions to practice exams and improving the homeworks. Aside from that, the course has a pretty standard lecture, homework, project structure, although the pacing is strange, as there are only three very large psets and everything except the project is done by the beginning of week nine. Jure is a fair lecturer, not great, not bad. There were several times when he didn't respond positively to student questions, even belittling the value of the question. The project is a standard open-ended AI/ML paper in the vein of 221 or 229. Our team got very minimal feedback from the course staff on it. Overall, it seems like the class still has substantial growing pains.

There might be less OHs than you're used to with other AI classes and you won't have a TA assigned to you to help with your project. This also means internet info if you're confused about a topic will be very sparse and sometimes your only option is to read the source publication.nn(2) To be relevant to the latest research, the assignments likely have to be updated every offering, so don't expect them to be polished like in CS 221 or 229. You almost have to rely on OH, Piazza, or a study group to get through the assignments and Colabs. You're bound to have clarifying questions at the minimum. The Colabs were designed to take a couple hours from what I understand, but the last two took me 10+, so start early lol. Pytorch and Google Colab both have some behaviors that will cause really obscure and frustrating bugs and you might not have enough experience working with those tools to diagnose and solve. The written HWs were generally more self contained and friendlier, but there were still ambiguities in cases that many people needed clarification on.nn(3) The course material will feel disjointed; every lecture is pretty independent of one another.

OH was handled poorly with limited hours, and the course staff occasionally did not get to everyone in the queue even if you signed up at the beginning of OH. The final project was a mess in guidance. They did not give specifications until halfway through the quarter and mandated that we could only use their OGB datasets with ambiguous grading criteria. Even when asking for feedback, we barely received any. Moreover, we had no compute credits this year, but the final project would give extra credit to students who used larger datasets and complex models, thereby favoring students who had \"extra\" resources. With the limited-to-no resources, our final project model tended to run out of space on Colab, even with efficiency improvements.

While at times frustrating due to lack of clarity in the instructions, the Colab assignments are great for learning how to get your hands dirty with PyTorch and implement the architectures you learn about in lecture. Speaking of lecture, you should definitely go to it, or watch the videos afterward -- Jure is a very good professor and can explain ML concepts in a way that is easy to understand. However, even though I have all these great things to say about the class and I would highly recommend it to anyone doing ML research, I must say that this quarter, the teaching staff was extremely disorganized and bad at communicating, which made the experience very frustrating. Do not take this class if you just want free space to work on your own graph ML project -- they did a bait and switch on us, only telling us that the project needed to be based on their OGB datasets after drop date. But if you are okay with doing a project from a constrained list of datasets and you can handle constant changes to the grading scheme and confusing communication (though this may have been a feature of a COVID quarter when everything needed to be re-worked), do take this class, you will gain a lot from it even though it isn't perfect.\", \"Good intro to the new field of GNNs, which likely still has lots of low-hanging fruit. Jure is the highlight of the course; he is very welcoming and excited, he loves answering students' questions, and he makes your thoughts and existence feel valued.

The project is a good chance to try the material out, but the grading based on performance can be very stressful, especially since we aren't given any computational resources. There are probably lots of people in the class, but more TA feedback as we work on the project would be nice, e.g., with a checkpoint meeting.\", 'Fantastic!', \"There's so much new research that's coming out of GNNs and I think this course does a very good job of covering them conceptually, with a little bit of math.

I wish we had a bit more practical work for HWs but it makes sense to also work on derivations of the models as well. One thing that was unfortunate was there were some course policy changes in grading in the middle of the course (change in how project was graded, cancelling colab 5 and making others worth more) that could've been hashed out earlier, but I didn't mind since I didn't really take the course to get a good grade per se.\", 'A must have', \"I don't like the project setup where students are tied to use the OGB.nnThat makes the grader's job easier but extremely limits students' exposure to real data and real problems.\", 'Lots of material covered.

A lot could be said about the bad aspects of this class, but ultimately it boils down to the whole experience just being frustrating.   Most notable were the PSETS, which were horrible. They each take a lot of time but none of that effort is spent to you gaining anything-it is just busy work. The problems are uninteresting, tedious, and lack any narrative as to why they matter. You could do most of the questions without even having watched lecture because they tested basic skills like being able to plot a chart as opposed to anything interesting.  Despite this ease, why does it take so much time do the PSETS? Because the SNAP python graph library has, without a doubt, the worst designed API I have ever laid eyes on. Here is a fun trivia question: you have a Graph.nodes() and a Graph.GetNodes() method. What do you think each one does? If you can get even a slightly accurate guess without looking at the documentation, you deserve a Nobel prize and tenure at Stanford. Every line you have to write with this library, you will have to constantly look up again and again because there is no intuitive way for you to remember what does what. Other than that, this quarter some of the questions were new so there were some bumps with that. However, this is expected from new questions so I wouldn't count that as a fault of the class.   Miscellaneous other things: 1) The late day policy is kind of dumb if you just need 5 more minutes to finish an assignment. 2) This class really shouldn't have a poster presentation.  3) The exam was impossibly long. 4) Some guest lectures were not great.   My concluding remarks are that this class has potential to be something really cool if the course staff had a morsel of a sense of pedagogy. Here are some actionable things to do that will make the course better: 1) Literally rm -rf the Snap.py library code and rewrite it. Alternatively, make the class use networkx-it's easier to install and use. 2) Hire a TA who has a better sense of pedagogy; specifically how to frame problem sets so they don't feel like a random collection of useless problems. 3) Keep working on the class, I am sure it will get better.  As a closing note, there are some reasons to take any negative course reviews with a grain of salt. Firstly, the class did a massive content overhaul so students experienced churn because of that. This is pretty natural so I wouldn't count that against the class. In addition, the TA's seemed heavily understaffed, so they had to deal with a lot.\", \"jure is a very good lecturer! you learn cool things and it is a different set of knowledge that you would gain from other ai classes. in terms of difficulty it's probably comparable to 221 but i don't think i spent as much time on this as i did in 221. much easier than 229 and much better taught too. so take it it'll be fun i just wish the psets were a lil more effective... also try not to be 10 lectures behind like i was lol\", \"Really interesting material, sometimes the lecture slides are FAR too dense and explanations are not always clear.

A lot of the techniques covered in it are very ad-hoc and not very theoretically justified. I guess that's just machine learning for you in general. Like yeah sure you can define centrality metric X or Y and show how to compute it and when it might work, but what does it really mean? No proofs of anything concrete really, just some fuzzy guesses. Jure is generally a good lecturer, but the guest lecturers are not nearly as clear. Especially the stochastic block model lecture, which was full of unexplained math and was virtually impossible to understand.  I would say the best thing about the class is that Jure's group produces most of the content they teach, so if this is the material you want to learn, there is absolutely no one better in the world to learn it from.\", \"go big or go home on the final project. don't cop out and just describe characteristics of a random network\", 'Class was very well structured!

The low prereqs set people who are newer to the field up for failure, or at least, a very hard chance at catching up to more experienced grad students. My other major complaint with the class is that the instructors may not put as much effort into creating assignments and providing feedback on projects as other classes do. As an example, one of the questions on the PSETs was implementing some novel ML graph-based models, and the starter code explicitly didn't work; I went to office hours 3 times within the first few days and was told that the TAs didn't know how to do the question either.

The course was recently redone to include more Graph Neural Network material and the incorporation has been rocky. The GNN homework was poorly written and the teaching team had to re-release a new version of the starter code. Despite being provided no other practice problems on GNNs, they composed a substantial portion of the final exam. Further, there were other organizational mishaps. For example, the TAs withheld the answers to the practice exams, encouraging us to come up with them collaboratively on a Google doc, then mysteriously released the answers two days before the test. The exam itself was intentionally made longer than the allotted two hour time span, which seemed unnecessary. I found it to be of comparable difficulty to other AI exams though. Homework difficulty was highly variable. Some problems were trivially easy while others were nigh impossible without scrolling through Piazza for clues or going to office hours, which tended to be overcrowded. To their credit, TAs were responsive to student feedback about matters such as releasing solutions to practice exams and improving the homeworks. Aside from that, the course has a pretty standard lecture, homework, project structure, although the pacing is strange, as there are only three very large psets and everything except the project is done by the beginning of week nine. Jure is a fair lecturer, not great, not bad. There were several times when he didn't respond positively to student questions, even belittling the value of the question. The project is a standard open-ended AI/ML paper in the vein of 221 or 229. Our team got very minimal feedback from the course staff on it.

This also means internet info if you're confused about a topic will be very sparse and sometimes your only option is to read the source publication.nn(2) To be relevant to the latest research, the assignments likely have to be updated every offering, so don't expect them to be polished like in CS 221 or 229. You almost have to rely on OH, Piazza, or a study group to get through the assignments and Colabs. You're bound to have clarifying questions at the minimum. The Colabs were designed to take a couple hours from what I understand, but the last two took me 10+, so start early lol. Pytorch and Google Colab both have some behaviors that will cause really obscure and frustrating bugs and you might not have enough experience working with those tools to diagnose and solve.

OH was handled poorly with limited hours, and the course staff occasionally did not get to everyone in the queue even if you signed up at the beginning of OH. The final project was a mess in guidance. They did not give specifications until halfway through the quarter and mandated that we could only use their OGB datasets with ambiguous grading criteria. Even when asking for feedback, we barely received any. Moreover, we had no compute credits this year, but the final project would give extra credit to students who used larger datasets and complex models, thereby favoring students who had \"extra\" resources. With the limited-to-no resources, our final project model tended to run out of space on Colab, even with efficiency improvements.

Speaking of lecture, you should definitely go to it, or watch the videos afterward -- Jure is a very good professor and can explain ML concepts in a way that is easy to understand. However, even though I have all these great things to say about the class and I would highly recommend it to anyone doing ML research, I must say that this quarter, the teaching staff was extremely disorganized and bad at communicating, which made the experience very frustrating. Do not take this class if you just want free space to work on your own graph ML project -- they did a bait and switch on us, only telling us that the project needed to be based on their OGB datasets after drop date. But if you are okay with doing a project from a constrained list of datasets and you can handle constant changes to the grading scheme and confusing communication (though this may have been a feature of a COVID quarter when everything needed to be re-worked), do take this class, you will gain a lot from it even though it isn't perfect.\", \"Good intro to the new field of GNNs, which likely still has lots of low-hanging fruit. Jure is the highlight of the course; he is very welcoming and excited, he loves answering students' questions, and he makes your thoughts and existence feel valued. The lectures are well-organized and relatively clear. The Colabs and homeworks can be a bit mechanical, and sometimes the homeworks are more theoretical than the lectures. The project is a good chance to try the material out, but the grading based on performance can be very stressful, especially since we aren't given any computational resources.

I wish we had a bit more practical work for HWs but it makes sense to also work on derivations of the models as well. One thing that was unfortunate was there were some course policy changes in grading in the middle of the course (change in how project was graded, cancelling colab 5 and making others worth more) that could've been hashed out earlier, but I didn't mind since I didn't really take the course to get a good grade per se.\", 'A must have', \"I don't like the project setup where students are tied to use the OGB.nnThat makes the grader's job easier but extremely limits students' exposure to real data and real problems.\", 'Lots of material covered.

Many opportunities for interesting final projects, as well.\", \"Interesting class, but it wasn't super organized this year.\", \"This is a great class to take if you have no other major time commitment courses in a given quarter.

I'm so glad a took it, but there were definitely some miserable nights.\", \"CS224W is kind of like communism-everything about it sounds great in the description. But in practice, the outcome is a woeful disaster.  Let's start with the positive. Firstly, Jure Leskovec is a great instructor. As far as professors go, he is an incredibly energetic and clear lecturer and is generally a really kind, friendly, and approachable human being. Furthermore, the TAs were also quite friendly, pretty active on piazza, and most impressively, they were very so on top of grading, with turnaround times of just one or two days!  A lot could be said about the bad aspects of this class, but ultimately it boils down to the whole experience just being frustrating.   Most notable were the PSETS, which were horrible. They each take a lot of time but none of that effort is spent to you gaining anything-it is just busy work. The problems are uninteresting, tedious, and lack any narrative as to why they matter. You could do most of the questions without even having watched lecture because they tested basic skills like being able to plot a chart as opposed to anything interesting.  Despite this ease, why does it take so much time do the PSETS? Because the SNAP python graph library has, without a doubt, the worst designed API I have ever laid eyes on. Here is a fun trivia question: you have a Graph.nodes() and a Graph.GetNodes() method. What do you think each one does? If you can get even a slightly accurate guess without looking at the documentation, you deserve a Nobel prize and tenure at Stanford. Every line you have to write with this library, you will have to constantly look up again and again because there is no intuitive way for you to remember what does what. Other than that, this quarter some of the questions were new so there were some bumps with that. However, this is expected from new questions so I wouldn't count that as a fault of the class.   Miscellaneous other things: 1) The late day policy is kind of dumb if you just need 5 more minutes to finish an assignment. 2) This class really shouldn't have a poster presentation.  3) The exam was impossibly long. 4) Some guest lectures were not great.   My concluding remarks are that this class has potential to be something really cool if the course staff had a morsel of a sense of pedagogy. Here are some actionable things to do that will make the course better: 1) Literally rm -rf the Snap.py library code and rewrite it. Alternatively, make the class use networkx-it's easier to install and use. 2) Hire a TA who has a better sense of pedagogy; specifically how to frame problem sets so they don't feel like a random collection of useless problems. 3) Keep working on the class, I am sure it will get better.  As a closing note, there are some reasons to take any negative course reviews with a grain of salt. Firstly, the class did a massive content overhaul so students experienced churn because of that. This is pretty natural so I wouldn't count that against the class. In addition, the TA's seemed heavily understaffed, so they had to deal with a lot.\", \"jure is a very good lecturer! you learn cool things and it is a different set of knowledge that you would gain from other ai classes. in terms of difficulty it's probably comparable to 221 but i don't think i spent as much time on this as i did in 221. much easier than 229 and much better taught too. so take it it'll be fun i just wish the psets were a lil more effective... also try not to be 10 lectures behind like i was lol\", \"Really interesting material, sometimes the lecture slides are FAR too dense and explanations are not always clear.

This is reflected in the homework and exams which are constructed to be time consuming but largely computational in nature, evaluating algorithms on example graphs by hand, implementing algorithms from pseudocode by hand ... etc. Overall, while the class provided some good insights, I would recommend choosing a different course offering with a more thoughtfully constructed curriculum and a higher learning to effort ratio.', \"Be wary of the linear algebra requirement - Pset 2 had a nasty linalg problem that I still don't really understand. The course is interesting in its concepts, and Jure is an amazing lecturer. I did feel that the material was a bit rushed and disconnected at times.

A lot of the techniques covered in it are very ad-hoc and not very theoretically justified. I guess that's just machine learning for you in general. Like yeah sure you can define centrality metric X or Y and show how to compute it and when it might work, but what does it really mean? No proofs of anything concrete really, just some fuzzy guesses. Jure is generally a good lecturer, but the guest lecturers are not nearly as clear. Especially the stochastic block model lecture, which was full of unexplained math and was virtually impossible to understand.  I would say the best thing about the class is that Jure's group produces most of the content they teach, so if this is the material you want to learn, there is absolutely no one better in the world to learn it from.\", \"go big or go home on the final project. don't cop out and just describe characteristics of a random network\", 'Class was very well structured!

Very disorganized, each lecture is about a random topic and nothing builds on anything else. I was going to take 246 next quarter but will not, because I don't want to have this professor again.

The low prereqs set people who are newer to the field up for failure, or at least, a very hard chance at catching up to more experienced grad students. My other major complaint with the class is that the instructors may not put as much effort into creating assignments and providing feedback on projects as other classes do. As an example, one of the questions on the PSETs was implementing some novel ML graph-based models, and the starter code explicitly didn't work; I went to office hours 3 times within the first few days and was told that the TAs didn't know how to do the question either.

The course was recently redone to include more Graph Neural Network material and the incorporation has been rocky. The GNN homework was poorly written and the teaching team had to re-release a new version of the starter code. Despite being provided no other practice problems on GNNs, they composed a substantial portion of the final exam. Further, there were other organizational mishaps. For example, the TAs withheld the answers to the practice exams, encouraging us to come up with them collaboratively on a Google doc, then mysteriously released the answers two days before the test. The exam itself was intentionally made longer than the allotted two hour time span, which seemed unnecessary. I found it to be of comparable difficulty to other AI exams though. Homework difficulty was highly variable. Some problems were trivially easy while others were nigh impossible without scrolling through Piazza for clues or going to office hours, which tended to be overcrowded. To their credit, TAs were responsive to student feedback about matters such as releasing solutions to practice exams and improving the homeworks. Aside from that, the course has a pretty standard lecture, homework, project structure, although the pacing is strange, as there are only three very large psets and everything except the project is done by the beginning of week nine. Jure is a fair lecturer, not great, not bad. There were several times when he didn't respond positively to student questions, even belittling the value of the question. The project is a standard open-ended AI/ML paper in the vein of 221 or 229. Our team got very minimal feedback from the course staff on it.

This also means internet info if you're confused about a topic will be very sparse and sometimes your only option is to read the source publication.nn(2) To be relevant to the latest research, the assignments likely have to be updated every offering, so don't expect them to be polished like in CS 221 or 229. You almost have to rely on OH, Piazza, or a study group to get through the assignments and Colabs. You're bound to have clarifying questions at the minimum. The Colabs were designed to take a couple hours from what I understand, but the last two took me 10+, so start early lol. Pytorch and Google Colab both have some behaviors that will cause really obscure and frustrating bugs and you might not have enough experience working with those tools to diagnose and solve.

Google Colab is too inefficient and unreliable to be used for any computationally intensive task. The decision to give students extra credit if they tackled medium sized datasets, which Google Colab would struggle to handle, also rewarded students who either had access to better resources or were willing to pay additional money to Google.', 'Very interesting class to learn a lot about graph models!', 'Course content is very up to date with the recent research developments in the area. Definitely take this course if people want to learn about the models currently actively used in the area. Also good course to develop research skills and learn about PyTorch.', 'This course is an introduction to using neural networks with graph structured data. The course material is extremely up to date, but one downside is that classical methods of social network analysis are covered extremely quickly. In the quarter that I took it, all of the material has been updated and the final project has been redesigned to have a great deal of structure, which actually was an enormous help during a remote quarter. Overall, I would highly recommend this course.', 'Jure is a great lecturer, and the content is fascinating. Unfortunately, the course is poorly organized and not well-supported by the teaching staff. It seems that they changed the assignments and course from last year, where everything is new. While there may be mistakes, the assignments were full of typos and mistakes. TAs were even confused by their own questions and had to defer to others. OH was handled poorly with limited hours, and the course staff occasionally did not get to everyone in the queue even if you signed up at the beginning of OH. The final project was a mess in guidance. They did not give specifications until halfway through the quarter and mandated that we could only use their OGB datasets with ambiguous grading criteria. Even when asking for feedback, we barely received any. Moreover, we had no compute credits this year, but the final project would give extra credit to students who used larger datasets and complex models, thereby favoring students who had \"extra\" resources. With the limited-to-no resources, our final project model tended to run out of space on Colab, even with efficiency improvements. Compared to other AI classes, this seemed to be the least organized and least supported AI class. I appreciate their efforts, but they did not adapt to better support the students. Overall, I really enjoyed the content but hope that the organization and support for this class improves.', 'A great of learning from this course, about Graph Neural Networks and its Applications.', \"This is a very good class that will teach you not only the basic theory / concepts, but also a LOT of practical knowledge. You will be able to employ many types of graph neural networks for your own research after this class. While at times frustrating due to lack of clarity in the instructions, the Colab assignments are great for learning how to get your hands dirty with PyTorch and implement the architectures you learn about in lecture. Speaking of lecture, you should definitely go to it, or watch the videos afterward -- Jure is a very good professor and can explain ML concepts in a way that is easy to understand. However, even though I have all these great things to say about the class and I would highly recommend it to anyone doing ML research, I must say that this quarter, the teaching staff was extremely disorganized and bad at communicating, which made the experience very frustrating. Do not take this class if you just want free space to work on your own graph ML project -- they did a bait and switch on us, only telling us that the project needed to be based on their OGB datasets after drop date. But if you are okay with doing a project from a constrained list of datasets and you can handle constant changes to the grading scheme and confusing communication (though this may have been a feature of a COVID quarter when everything needed to be re-worked), do take this class, you will gain a lot from it even though it isn't perfect.\", \"Good intro to the new field of GNNs, which likely still has lots of low-hanging fruit. Jure is the highlight of the course; he is very welcoming and excited, he loves answering students' questions, and he makes your thoughts and existence feel valued. The lectures are well-organized and relatively clear. The Colabs and homeworks can be a bit mechanical, and sometimes the homeworks are more theoretical than the lectures. The project is a good chance to try the material out, but the grading based on performance can be very stressful, especially since we aren't given any computational resources. There are probably lots of people in the class, but more TA feedback as we work on the project would be nice, e.g., with a checkpoint meeting.\", 'Fantastic!', \"There's so much new research that's coming out of GNNs and I think this course does a very good job of covering them conceptually, with a little bit of math. The Has are more math/derivation based whereas Colabs are more implementation in PyTorch based. Sometimes I felt like there was just so much material to cover so quickly so we glanced over some of the details, but overall conceptually I think most areas were explained very well. I wish we had a bit more practical work for HWs but it makes sense to also work on derivations of the models as well. One thing that was unfortunate was there were some course policy changes in grading in the middle of the course (change in how project was graded, cancelling colab 5 and making others worth more) that could've been hashed out earlier, but I didn't mind since I didn't really take the course to get a good grade per se.\", 'A must have', \"I don't like the project setup where students are tied to use the OGB.nnThat makes the grader's job easier but extremely limits students' exposure to real data and real problems.\", 'Lots of material covered.

The professor presents the information really clearly, and graphs are a really interesting and applicable topic! It's also well-structured with homework assignments and colabs. Start the final project early--it was worth a lot of the grade in my iteration of the class but there were no checkpoints along the way, so I definitely fell into the trap of not working on it until the week it was due, and that cost a lot of time since some models take a long time to train and a lot of stress the last week.\", 'This is a great course, thought by one of the pioneers in Graph Neural Networks.

Many opportunities for interesting final projects, as well.\", \"Interesting class, but it wasn't super organized this year.\", \"This is a great class to take if you have no other major time commitment courses in a given quarter.

I'm so glad a took it, but there were definitely some miserable nights.\", \"CS224W is kind of like communism-everything about it sounds great in the description. But in practice, the outcome is a woeful disaster.  Let's start with the positive. Firstly, Jure Leskovec is a great instructor. As far as professors go, he is an incredibly energetic and clear lecturer and is generally a really kind, friendly, and approachable human being. Furthermore, the TAs were also quite friendly, pretty active on piazza, and most impressively, they were very so on top of grading, with turnaround times of just one or two days!  A lot could be said about the bad aspects of this class, but ultimately it boils down to the whole experience just being frustrating.   Most notable were the PSETS, which were horrible. They each take a lot of time but none of that effort is spent to you gaining anything-it is just busy work. The problems are uninteresting, tedious, and lack any narrative as to why they matter. You could do most of the questions without even having watched lecture because they tested basic skills like being able to plot a chart as opposed to anything interesting.  Despite this ease, why does it take so much time do the PSETS? Because the SNAP python graph library has, without a doubt, the worst designed API I have ever laid eyes on. Here is a fun trivia question: you have a Graph.nodes() and a Graph.GetNodes() method. What do you think each one does? If you can get even a slightly accurate guess without looking at the documentation, you deserve a Nobel prize and tenure at Stanford. Every line you have to write with this library, you will have to constantly look up again and again because there is no intuitive way for you to remember what does what. Other than that, this quarter some of the questions were new so there were some bumps with that. However, this is expected from new questions so I wouldn't count that as a fault of the class.   Miscellaneous other things: 1) The late day policy is kind of dumb if you just need 5 more minutes to finish an assignment. 2) This class really shouldn't have a poster presentation.  3) The exam was impossibly long. 4) Some guest lectures were not great.   My concluding remarks are that this class has potential to be something really cool if the course staff had a morsel of a sense of pedagogy. Here are some actionable things to do that will make the course better: 1) Literally rm -rf the Snap.py library code and rewrite it. Alternatively, make the class use networkx-it's easier to install and use. 2) Hire a TA who has a better sense of pedagogy; specifically how to frame problem sets so they don't feel like a random collection of useless problems. 3) Keep working on the class, I am sure it will get better.  As a closing note, there are some reasons to take any negative course reviews with a grain of salt. Firstly, the class did a massive content overhaul so students experienced churn because of that. This is pretty natural so I wouldn't count that against the class. In addition, the TA's seemed heavily understaffed, so they had to deal with a lot.\", \"jure is a very good lecturer! you learn cool things and it is a different set of knowledge that you would gain from other ai classes. in terms of difficulty it's probably comparable to 221 but i don't think i spent as much time on this as i did in 221. much easier than 229 and much better taught too. so take it it'll be fun i just wish the psets were a lil more effective... also try not to be 10 lectures behind like i was lol\", \"Really interesting material, sometimes the lecture slides are FAR too dense and explanations are not always clear.

This is reflected in the homework and exams which are constructed to be time consuming but largely computational in nature, evaluating algorithms on example graphs by hand, implementing algorithms from pseudocode by hand ... etc. Overall, while the class provided some good insights, I would recommend choosing a different course offering with a more thoughtfully constructed curriculum and a higher learning to effort ratio.', \"Be wary of the linear algebra requirement - Pset 2 had a nasty linalg problem that I still don't really understand. The course is interesting in its concepts, and Jure is an amazing lecturer. I did feel that the material was a bit rushed and disconnected at times.

The project was a bit tough to work on throughout the quarter, so make sure to stay on top of that\", \"Probably don't take it. A lot of the techniques covered in it are very ad-hoc and not very theoretically justified. I guess that's just machine learning for you in general. Like yeah sure you can define centrality metric X or Y and show how to compute it and when it might work, but what does it really mean? No proofs of anything concrete really, just some fuzzy guesses. Jure is generally a good lecturer, but the guest lecturers are not nearly as clear. Especially the stochastic block model lecture, which was full of unexplained math and was virtually impossible to understand.  I would say the best thing about the class is that Jure's group produces most of the content they teach, so if this is the material you want to learn, there is absolutely no one better in the world to learn it from.\", \"go big or go home on the final project. don't cop out and just describe characteristics of a random network\", 'Class was very well structured!

Very disorganized, each lecture is about a random topic and nothing builds on anything else. I was going to take 246 next quarter but will not, because I don't want to have this professor again.

The low prereqs set people who are newer to the field up for failure, or at least, a very hard chance at catching up to more experienced grad students. My other major complaint with the class is that the instructors may not put as much effort into creating assignments and providing feedback on projects as other classes do. As an example, one of the questions on the PSETs was implementing some novel ML graph-based models, and the starter code explicitly didn't work; I went to office hours 3 times within the first few days and was told that the TAs didn't know how to do the question either.

The course was recently redone to include more Graph Neural Network material and the incorporation has been rocky. The GNN homework was poorly written and the teaching team had to re-release a new version of the starter code. Despite being provided no other practice problems on GNNs, they composed a substantial portion of the final exam. Further, there were other organizational mishaps. For example, the TAs withheld the answers to the practice exams, encouraging us to come up with them collaboratively on a Google doc, then mysteriously released the answers two days before the test. The exam itself was intentionally made longer than the allotted two hour time span, which seemed unnecessary. I found it to be of comparable difficulty to other AI exams though. Homework difficulty was highly variable. Some problems were trivially easy while others were nigh impossible without scrolling through Piazza for clues or going to office hours, which tended to be overcrowded. To their credit, TAs were responsive to student feedback about matters such as releasing solutions to practice exams and improving the homeworks. Aside from that, the course has a pretty standard lecture, homework, project structure, although the pacing is strange, as there are only three very large psets and everything except the project is done by the beginning of week nine. Jure is a fair lecturer, not great, not bad. There were several times when he didn't respond positively to student questions, even belittling the value of the question. The project is a standard open-ended AI/ML paper in the vein of 221 or 229. Our team got very minimal feedback from the course staff on it. Overall, it seems like the class still has substantial growing pains.

However, know what you're getting yourself into, because pedagogically, this has to be one of the most ambitious AI classes to design & teach. Jure and the CAs are getting you from zero to hero in the latest in Graph-based learning, a field which is so new and bleeding edge as it stands. This causes a few issues:nn(1) There's only a handful of people at Stanford who can help administer this class, so go in knowing that there will be limited help. There might be less OHs than you're used to with other AI classes and you won't have a TA assigned to you to help with your project. This also means internet info if you're confused about a topic will be very sparse and sometimes your only option is to read the source publication.nn(2) To be relevant to the latest research, the assignments likely have to be updated every offering, so don't expect them to be polished like in CS 221 or 229. You almost have to rely on OH, Piazza, or a study group to get through the assignments and Colabs. You're bound to have clarifying questions at the minimum. The Colabs were designed to take a couple hours from what I understand, but the last two took me 10+, so start early lol. Pytorch and Google Colab both have some behaviors that will cause really obscure and frustrating bugs and you might not have enough experience working with those tools to diagnose and solve. The written HWs were generally more self contained and friendlier, but there were still ambiguities in cases that many people needed clarification on.nn(3) The course material will feel disjointed; every lecture is pretty independent of one another. You'll go from discussing k-hop neighborhoods and graphlets to Graph NNs quite quickly, and the GNN concepts aren't necessarily related. I tend to like courses like CS109 where stuff cleanly builds on each other, but in AI classes this is pretty rare, so not a huge deal.nnJust keep in mind these inherent quirks of this ambitious class and you'll at the minimum learn a ton. Forming a study group will also be massively helpful so you can rely on peers for help instead of the teaching staff which are swamped with questions. I didn't know anyone else in this class going in but still managed to find one!\", 'Definitely recommended if you want to know more about machine learning', 'Nice survey of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for graph-structured data. Note that there is now a much higher emphasis on deep learning compared to previous iterations of the course. The assignments give you a mix of hands-on experience and theoretical exercises.', \"Great course for understanding graph neural networks. Jure is a leader in this field, so you can't ask for a better instructor!\", 'The course is very well organized and Jure is at the forefront of Graph Learning, having published some of the most impactful papers in the field. This is definitely a must-take class and probably the class I enjoyed the most during my time at Stanford. The homeworks and colabs were not hard at all and were well-structured. Be prepared for fast-paced lectures that are packed and full of information that is critical for doing well in the class.', 'This is a very intense course. While working on the project you need to do a lot of research, collaborate well with your teammates and be ready to take the challenge of experimenting multiple directions of exploring and solving the problem. nnThe material covered may or may not be applicable immediately at your workplace, but it is always good to know the theory behind the details. We never know when and in what context the depth of knowledge would be useful.', \"Interesting content, but not the most formulated course. Project this year was restricted to a set of the teaching team's own datasets which made it less interesting/open-ended than comparable AI courses.\", 'I went from knowing nothing about deep learning or graphical models to being able to understand recent literature in 6 weeks. I cannot recommend this class highly enough as it is likely there are applications of graph ML to your research, and you may not even know it!', \"Although, I wish there were more OH the TA's were incredibly helpful. I learned a ton as a non-CS student (physics). The class is as promised self-contained and can be considerably helpful even when you have only a little experience in ML. Highly recommend.\", \"It would have bee great if this quarter's course project didn't take points off of projects that were not modeled after the conference papers posted on the project guidelines doc. That way people would have had more freedom to explore what they're most excited about in this area.\", 'I found Prof. Leskovec to be an excellent lecturer - I particularly appreciated his use of examples to illustrate important concepts.', 'Make sure that this is the only CS class you take in a quarter since it is time consuming due a lot of homework and Colabs. Also, there is a LOT of material. But overall, it is a great class and Jure is a great teacher.', \"This is a fantastic course and Jure is a great professor who really cares about teaching and student success. It's also amazing how cutting-edge the algorithm that we learn are, and it's a great introduction into an extremely active field of AI.\", 'The lectures and the quality of instruction were consistently excellent throughout. There was one puzzling choice that left a sour taste in my mouth, however, which was the decision not to give students Google Cloud credits like all other AI courses that I took in the past. Google Colab is too inefficient and unreliable to be used for any computationally intensive task. The decision to give students extra credit if they tackled medium sized datasets, which Google Colab would struggle to handle, also rewarded students who either had access to better resources or were willing to pay additional money to Google.', 'Very interesting class to learn a lot about graph models!', 'Course content is very up to date with the recent research developments in the area. Definitely take this course if people want to learn about the models currently actively used in the area. Also good course to develop research skills and learn about PyTorch.', 'This course is an introduction to using neural networks with graph structured data. The course material is extremely up to date, but one downside is that classical methods of social network analysis are covered extremely quickly. In the quarter that I took it, all of the material has been updated and the final project has been redesigned to have a great deal of structure, which actually was an enormous help during a remote quarter. Overall, I would highly recommend this course.', 'Jure is a great lecturer, and the content is fascinating. Unfortunately, the course is poorly organized and not well-supported by the teaching staff. It seems that they changed the assignments and course from last year, where everything is new. While there may be mistakes, the assignments were full of typos and mistakes. TAs were even confused by their own questions and had to defer to others. OH was handled poorly with limited hours, and the course staff occasionally did not get to everyone in the queue even if you signed up at the beginning of OH. The final project was a mess in guidance. They did not give specifications until halfway through the quarter and mandated that we could only use their OGB datasets with ambiguous grading criteria. Even when asking for feedback, we barely received any. Moreover, we had no compute credits this year, but the final project would give extra credit to students who used larger datasets and complex models, thereby favoring students who had \"extra\" resources. With the limited-to-no resources, our final project model tended to run out of space on Colab, even with efficiency improvements. Compared to other AI classes, this seemed to be the least organized and least supported AI class. I appreciate their efforts, but they did not adapt to better support the students. Overall, I really enjoyed the content but hope that the organization and support for this class improves.', 'A great of learning from this course, about Graph Neural Networks and its Applications.', \"This is a very good class that will teach you not only the basic theory / concepts, but also a LOT of practical knowledge. You will be able to employ many types of graph neural networks for your own research after this class. While at times frustrating due to lack of clarity in the instructions, the Colab assignments are great for learning how to get your hands dirty with PyTorch and implement the architectures you learn about in lecture. Speaking of lecture, you should definitely go to it, or watch the videos afterward -- Jure is a very good professor and can explain ML concepts in a way that is easy to understand. However, even though I have all these great things to say about the class and I would highly recommend it to anyone doing ML research, I must say that this quarter, the teaching staff was extremely disorganized and bad at communicating, which made the experience very frustrating. Do not take this class if you just want free space to work on your own graph ML project -- they did a bait and switch on us, only telling us that the project needed to be based on their OGB datasets after drop date. But if you are okay with doing a project from a constrained list of datasets and you can handle constant changes to the grading scheme and confusing communication (though this may have been a feature of a COVID quarter when everything needed to be re-worked), do take this class, you will gain a lot from it even though it isn't perfect.\", \"Good intro to the new field of GNNs, which likely still has lots of low-hanging fruit. Jure is the highlight of the course; he is very welcoming and excited, he loves answering students' questions, and he makes your thoughts and existence feel valued. The lectures are well-organized and relatively clear. The Colabs and homeworks can be a bit mechanical, and sometimes the homeworks are more theoretical than the lectures. The project is a good chance to try the material out, but the grading based on performance can be very stressful, especially since we aren't given any computational resources. There are probably lots of people in the class, but more TA feedback as we work on the project would be nice, e.g., with a checkpoint meeting.\", 'Fantastic!', \"There's so much new research that's coming out of GNNs and I think this course does a very good job of covering them conceptually, with a little bit of math. The Has are more math/derivation based whereas Colabs are more implementation in PyTorch based. Sometimes I felt like there was just so much material to cover so quickly so we glanced over some of the details, but overall conceptually I think most areas were explained very well. I wish we had a bit more practical work for HWs but it makes sense to also work on derivations of the models as well. One thing that was unfortunate was there were some course policy changes in grading in the middle of the course (change in how project was graded, cancelling colab 5 and making others worth more) that could've been hashed out earlier, but I didn't mind since I didn't really take the course to get a good grade per se.\", 'A must have', \"I don't like the project setup where students are tied to use the OGB.nnThat makes the grader's job easier but extremely limits students' exposure to real data and real problems.\", 'Lots of material covered. Final project was standardized this year \u2014 with the project specs not released until after the drop deadline. Made taking this class as a grad student less than ideal since I could not pursue research topics. Still, instruction and course overall is informative.', \"I would definitely recommend this course! The professor presents the information really clearly, and graphs are a really interesting and applicable topic! It's also well-structured with homework assignments and colabs. Start the final project early--it was worth a lot of the grade in my iteration of the class but there were no checkpoints along the way, so I definitely fell into the trap of not working on it until the week it was due, and that cost a lot of time since some models take a long time to train and a lot of stress the last week.\", 'This is a great course, thought by one of the pioneers in Graph Neural Networks. Super interesting content and extremely valuable!', \"I thought the project guidance was a little bit unclear and not ideal, especially the amount of focus on leaderboard results and metrics instead of evaluating more on the quality of analysis and how much learning was demonstrated. However, I also heard that this is the first quarter that the projects were organized in their current form, so it's understandable that some adjustments are still being made. nnnnAlso, as a matter of personal opinion I think it would have been nice to have more evaluation via quizzes or even exams and less weight on the final project.\", 'great!', 'Jure is a great lecturer and the material was very interesting.  However, the final project was not very well organized and very little freedom was allowed.', 'Artificial intelligence is constantly evolving, graphs structures are much used than before (social networks,chemistry,...), this course gives us deeper skills on Machine Learning with Graphs, that is very interesting.', 'A must-take if you are interested in ML and graphs. The Colabs are great materials to learn how to implement Graph Neural Networks.nnThe topics covered in the lectures are advanced and cutting-edge but also unique.', 'Highly recommend to AI students', 'Highly recommend this course! Jure surely knows his stuff, and GNNs are a rapidly evolving field in ML.'], 'is_lot_of_work': 'Yes, this course is a lot of work. It is described as very intense, requiring a significant amount of research, collaboration, and experimentation. There is a lot of material covered, and students are advised to take it as their only CS class in a quarter due to its time-consuming nature, including homework and projects.
