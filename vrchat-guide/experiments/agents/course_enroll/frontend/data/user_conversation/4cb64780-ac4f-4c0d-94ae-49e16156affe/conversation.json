This course explores the synergy. Students will learn from faculty and industry experts how to build faster and fairer financial systems. Topics include network infrastructure: data center fabrics, ultra-low latency trading systems; cloud computing infrastructure: building large-scale risk computation platforms using virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing. A particular focus will be on challenges and opportunities presented by cloud-native financial exchanges: the course will provide such an exchange and student groups will write programs for high-frequency and algorithmic trading.

This course is about using a variety of techniques from machine learning and theories from social science to study human behaviors and important societal questions at scale. Topics will include methods for natural language processing and causal inference, and their applications to important societal questions around hate speech, misinformation, and social movements.\n\n3. **Course Title:** Machine Learning for Sequence Modeling\n   - **Course Codes:** CS 229B, STATS 232\n   - **Description:** Sequence data and time series are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in fields as diverse as bioinformatics, neuroscience, health, environmental monitoring, finance, speech recognition/generation, video processing, and natural language processing. Machine learning has become an indispensable tool for analyzing such data; in fact, sequence models lie at the heart of recent progress in AI like GPT3. This class integrates foundational concepts in time series analysis with modern machine learning methods for sequence modeling. Connections and key differences will be highlighted, as well as how grounding modern neural network approaches with traditional interpretations can enable powerful leaps forward.
