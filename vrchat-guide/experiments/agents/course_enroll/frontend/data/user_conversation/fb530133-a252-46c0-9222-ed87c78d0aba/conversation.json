This course is about algorithms for deep reinforcement learning - methods for learning behavior from experience, with a focus on practical algorithms that use deep neural networks to learn behavior from high-dimensional observations. Topics will include methods for learning from demonstrations, both model-based and model-free deep RL methods, methods for learning from offline datasets, and more advanced techniques for learning multiple tasks such as goal-conditioned RL, meta-RL, and unsupervised skill discovery. These methods will be instantiated with examples from domains with high-dimensional state and action spaces, such as robotics, visual navigation, and control. This course is complementary to CS234, which neither being a pre-requisite for the other. In comparison to CS234, this course will have a more applied and deep learning focus and an emphasis on use-cases in robotics and motor control.'}, {'course_id': 217009, 'course_codes': ['CME 251', 'CS 233'], 'title': 'Geometric and Topological Data Analysis', 'description': 'Mathematical and computational tools for the analysis of data with geometric content, such images, videos, 3D scans, GPS traces -- as well as for other data embedded into geometric spaces.

The course focuses on four concepts: explanations, fairness, privacy, and robustness. We first discuss how to explain and interpret ML model outputs and inner workings. Then, we examine how bias and unfairness can arise in ML models and learn strategies to mitigate this problem. Next, we look at differential privacy and membership inference in the context of models leaking sensitive information when they are not supposed to. Finally, we look at adversarial attacks and methods for imparting robustness against adversarial manipulation.Students will gain understanding of a set of methods and tools for deploying transparent, ethically sound, and robust machine learning solutions. Students will complete labs, homework assignments, and discuss weekly readings. Prerequisites: CS229 or similar introductory Python-based ML class; knowledge of deep learning such as CS230, CS231N; familiarity with ML frameworks in Python (scikit-learn, Keras) assumed.'}, {'course_id': 222464, 'course_codes': ['CS 348I'], 'title': 'Computer Graphics in the Era of AI', 'description': 'This course introduces deep learning methods and AI technologies applied to four main areas of Computer Graphics: rendering, geometry, animation, and imaging. We will study a wide range of problems on content creation for images, shapes, and animations, recently advanced by deep learning techniques. For each problem, we will understand its conventional solutions, study the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches, and critically evaluate their results as well as the impacts to researchers and practitioners in Computer Graphics. The topics include differentiable rendering/neural rendering, BRDF estimation, texture synthesis, denoising, procedural modeling, view synthesis, colorization, style transfer, motion synthesis, differentiable physics simulation, and reinforcement learning. Through programming projects and homework, students who successfully complete this course will be able to use neural rendering algorithms for image manipulation, apply neural procedural modeling for shape and scene synthesis, exploit data-driven methods for simulating physical phenomena, and implement policy learning algorithms for creating character animation.
