Here are some of the classes I found:\n\n1. **CS 144: Introduction to Computer Networking**\n   - **Description**: Principles and practice. Structure and components of computer networks, with focus on the Internet. Packet switching, layering, and routing. Transport and TCP: reliable delivery over an unreliable network, flow control, congestion control. Network names, addresses, and Ethernet switching. Includes significant programming component in C/C++; students build portions of the Internet TCP/IP software.\n   - **Prerequisite**: CS110.\n\n2. **CS 243: Program Analysis and Optimizations**\n   - **Description**: Program analysis techniques used in compilers and software development tools to improve productivity, reliability, and security. Methodology of applying mathematical abstractions such as graphs, fixpoint computations, binary decision diagrams in writing complex software, using compilers as an example. Topics include data flow analysis, instruction scheduling, register allocation, parallelism, data locality, interprocedural analysis, and garbage collection.\n   - **Prerequisites**: 103 or 103B, and 107.\n\n3. **CS 240: Advanced Topics in Operating Systems**\n   - **Description**: Recent research. Classic and new papers. Topics: virtual memory management, synchronization and communication, file systems, protection and security, operating system extension techniques, fault tolerance, and the history and experience of systems programming.\n   - **Prerequisite**: 140 or equivalent.\n\n4. **CS 249I: The Modern Internet**\n   - **Description**: Advanced networking course that covers how the Internet has evolved and operates today. Topics include modern Internet topology and routing practices, recently introduced network protocols, popular content delivery strategies, and pressing privacy, security, and abuse challenges. The course consists of a mixture of lecture, guest talks, and investigative projects where students will analyze how the Internet operates in practice.\n   - **Prerequisite**: CS 144, EE 284, or equivalent.\n\n5. **CS 149: Parallel Computing**\n   - **Description**: Introduction to parallelism and parallel programming. Topics: varieties of parallelism in current hardware (e.g., fast networks, multicore, accelerators such as GPUs, vector instruction sets), importance of locality, implicit vs. explicit parallelism, shared vs. non-shared memory, synchronization mechanisms (locking, atomicity, transactions, barriers), and parallel programming models (threads, data parallel/streaming, MapReduce, Apache Spark, SPMD, message passing, SIMT, transactions, and nested parallelism). Significant parallel programming assignments will be given as homework.\n   - **Prerequisite**: The course is open to students who have completed the introductory CS course sequence through 111.\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
