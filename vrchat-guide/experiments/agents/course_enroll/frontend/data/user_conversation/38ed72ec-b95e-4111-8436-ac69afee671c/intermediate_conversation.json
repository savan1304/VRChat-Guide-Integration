It highlights the challenges involved in creating such robots, particularly the need for them to coordinate their movements with humans and ensure safety and reliability in everyday environments. The document outlines a hands-on project-based course for students, where they will explore current and future opportunities for autonomous robots, and gain practical experience with essential technologies related to robot perception, action, interaction, and learning.
