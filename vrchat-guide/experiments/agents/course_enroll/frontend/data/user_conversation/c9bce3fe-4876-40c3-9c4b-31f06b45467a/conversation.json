Students learn how computers work and what they can do through hands-on exercises. In particular, students will see the capabilities and weaknesses of computer systems so they are not mysterious or intimidating. Course features many small programming exercises, although no prior programming experience is assumed or required. CS101 is not a complete programming course such as CS106A. CS101 is effectively an alternative to CS105. A laptop computer is recommended for the in-class exercises.\n\n2. **Working with Data - Tools and Techniques (CS 102)**\n   - Description: Aimed at non-CS undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn a variety of tools and techniques for working with data. Many of the world's biggest discoveries and decisions in science, technology, business, medicine, politics, and society as a whole, are now being made on the basis of analyzing data sets. This course provides a broad and practical introduction to working with data: data analysis techniques including databases, data mining, machine learning, and data visualization; data analysis tools including spreadsheets, Tableau, relational databases and SQL, Python, and R; introduction to network analysis and unstructured data. Tools and techniques are hands-on but at a cursory level, providing a basis for future exploration and application. Prerequisites: comfort with basic logic and mathematical concepts, along with high school AP computer science, CS106A, or other equivalent programming experience.\n\n3. **Problem-solving Lab for CS106A (CS 100ACE)**\n   - Description: Additional problem solving practice for the introductory CS course CS 106A. Sections are designed to allow students to acquire a deeper understanding of CS and its applications, work collaboratively, and develop a mastery of the material. Limited enrollment, permission of instructor required. Concurrent enrollment in CS 106A required.\n\n4. **Introduction to Computing at Stanford (CS 1C, VPTL 1)**\n   - Description: For those who want to learn more about Stanford's computing environment. Topics include: computer maintenance and security, computing resources, Internet privacy, and copyright law.
