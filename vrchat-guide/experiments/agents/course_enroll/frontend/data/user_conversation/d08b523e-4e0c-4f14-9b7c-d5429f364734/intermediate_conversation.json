The primary focus is on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the Python language. Topics include: Pythonic conventions, data structures such as list comprehensions, anonymous functions, iterables, powerful built-ins (e.g. map, filter, zip), and Python libraries. For the last few weeks, students will work with course staff to develop their own significant Python project. Prerequisite: CS106B, CS106X, or equivalent.\n   - **Average Hours Spent:** 5.36\n\n2. **Course Title:** CS + Social Good Studio: Implementing Social Good Projects\n   - **Course Code:** CS 52\n   - **Description:** Continuation of CS51 (CS + Social Good Studio). Teams enter the quarter having completed and tested a minimal viable product (MVP) with a well-defined target user, and a community partner. Students will learn to apply scalable technical frameworks, methods to measure social impact, tools for deployment, user acquisition techniques and growth/exit strategies. The purpose of the class is to facilitate students to build a sustainable infrastructure around their product idea. CS52 will host mentors, guest speakers and industry experts for various workshops and coaching-sessions. The class culminates in a showcase where students share their projects with stakeholders and the public. Prerequisite: CS 51, or consent of instructor.\n   - **Average Hours Spent:** 5.04\n\n3. **Course Title:** Dissecting The Modern Computer\n   - **Course Code:** CS 80E\n   - **Description:** In this course, students will be given a high-level, accessible introduction to computer architecture through the use of the RISC-V ISA. Through a series of interactive units, students will learn about the inner-workings of computers, from the execution of our programs all the way down to the hardware that runs them. Topics include simple digital circuits, assembly, simple processors, memory systems (Cache, DRAM, Disk), and bonus topics like GPU's. After completing this class, students should have a newfound appreciation for how incredible computational technology is, as well as direction to fantastic classes that delve into some of these topics in more detail, like CS149, EE108, and EE180. Prerequisite: CS106B.\n   - **Average Hours Spent:** Not provided\n\n4. **Course Title:** How to Make VR: Introduction to Virtual Reality Design and Development\n   - **Course Code:** CS 11SI\n   - **Description:** In this hands-on, experiential course, students will design and develop virtual reality applications. You'll learn how to use the Unity game engine, the most popular platform for creating immersive applications. The class will teach the design best practices and the creation pipeline for VR applications. Students will work in groups to present a final project in building an application for the Oculus Quest 2 headset. Enrollment is limited and by application only. See https://cs11si.stanford.edu for more information and the link to the application. Prerequisite: CS 106A or equivalent\n   - **Average Hours Spent:** Not provided\n\n5. **Course Title:** Topics in Computer Networks\n   - **Course Code:** CS 344\n   - **Description:** This class could also be called \"Build an Internet Router\": Students work in teams of two to build a fully functioning Internet router, gaining hands-on experience building the hardware and software of a high-performance network system. Students design the control plane in C on a Linux host and design the data plane in the new P4 language on both a software switch and a high-speed hardware switch (e.g., Intel Tofino). For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the other teams by building a small scale datacenter topology. In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router). No Verilog or FPGA programming experience is required. May be repeated for credit.\n   - **Average Hours Spent:** 13.6\n\nCould you please provide the name of the next course you would like to take?",
