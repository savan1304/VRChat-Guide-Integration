It covers Pythonic conventions, data structures like list comprehensions, anonymous functions, iterables, and Python libraries. Students will work on a significant Python project. Prerequisite: CS106B, CS106X, or equivalent.\n\n2. **CS + Social Good Studio: Implementing Social Good Projects (CS 52)**\n   - Description: This course continues from CS51, where teams have completed a minimal viable product. It covers scalable technical frameworks, measuring social impact, deployment tools, user acquisition, and growth strategies. Prerequisite: CS 51, or consent of instructor.\n\n3. **Dissecting The Modern Computer (CS 80E)**\n   - Description: This course introduces computer architecture using the RISC-V ISA. Topics include digital circuits, assembly, processors, and memory systems. Students will gain a deeper understanding of computational technology. Prerequisite: CS106B.\n\n4. **How to Make VR: Introduction to Virtual Reality Design and Development (CS 11SI)**\n   - Description: This course focuses on designing and developing virtual reality applications using the Unity game engine. Students will work in groups to build an application for the Oculus Quest 2 headset. Prerequisite: CS 106A or equivalent.\n\n5. **Topics in Computer Networks (CS 344)**\n   - Description: Students work in teams to build a fully functioning Internet router, gaining experience in hardware and software of network systems. The course includes a midterm milestone and an open-ended design challenge.

For the midterm milestone, teams must demonstrate that their routers can interoperate with the other teams by building a small scale datacenter topology. In the final 3-4 weeks of the class, teams will participate in an open-ended design challenge. Prerequisites: At least one student in each team must have taken CS144 at Stanford and completed Lab 3 (static router). No Verilog or FPGA programming experience is required.
