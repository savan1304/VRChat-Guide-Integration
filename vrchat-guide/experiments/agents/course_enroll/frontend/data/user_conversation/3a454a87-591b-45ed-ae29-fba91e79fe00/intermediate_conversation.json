Here are the top courses:\n\n1. **CS 93: Teaching AI**\n   - Average Rating: 5.0\n   - Summary: The course is praised for its valuable skills, including effective office hours, lecture explanations, and research paper critiques. It's recommended for its practical tips and low-commitment opportunity to practice presenting concepts and resolving conflicts, especially in AI projects.\n\n2. **CS 347: Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Frontiers**\n   - Average Rating: 4.9\n   - Summary: The course is well-received for its excellent teaching, cutting-edge research topics, and rigorous workload. It's noted for revitalizing interest in HCI with a broader perspective and more discussion on theory and ethics.\n\n3. **CS 347: Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Frontiers**\n   - Average Rating: 4.8 (Note: This is another review of the same course)\n   - Summary: Students find it engaging and informative, with strong support from instructors and TAs. It covers a wide range of HCI topics in depth, making it valuable for those interested in HCI research.\n\n4. **CS 347: Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Frontiers**\n   - Average Rating: 4.8 (Note: Yet another review of the same course)\n   - Summary: The course offers a comprehensive overview of HCI research with a focus on research techniques and current advancements. It requires significant reading and writing assignments but is found to be intellectually stimulating.\n\n5. **CS 197: Computer Science Research**\n   - Average Rating: 4.8\n   - Summary: The course is a positive introduction to CS research, with helpful teaching staff and a valuable learning experience. While some assignments are time-consuming, the overall course is manageable.\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
