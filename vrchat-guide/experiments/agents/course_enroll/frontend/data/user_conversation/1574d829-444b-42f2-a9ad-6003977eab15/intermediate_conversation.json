It includes faculty lectures on fundamental research concepts and mentorship through special interest group meetings, where students receive feedback on a real research project. Topics covered include reading technical papers, improving oral communication and technical writing skills, and developing independent research questions. Students can enroll for 4 units and choose a research area for a team programming project with a Ph.D. student mentor, although space may be limited. The prerequisite for enrollment is CS106B.\n\n2. **Designing for Accessibility (CS 377Q, ME 214)**\n   - **Summary**: This course discusses the importance of designing for accessibility within the UX community, highlighting the growing awareness among businesses regarding the needs of individuals with disabilities. It emphasizes the benefits of universal design, which not only addresses accessibility but also enhances usability for everyone. The class introduces fundamental Human Computer Interaction (HCI) concepts and involves individual assignments where students will identify accessibility needs, prototype design solutions, and conduct user studies with individuals with disabilities. The focus is on accessibility in various digital platforms, including computers, mobile phones, and VR, and requires a design class prerequisite.\n\n3. **Human-Computer Interaction: Foundations and Frontiers (CS 347)**\n   - **Summary**: This course focuses on the future of human-computer interaction (HCI). It aims to equip students with key theories related to HCI and connect them to contemporary research innovations. The course covers various theories from interaction, social computing, and design, addressing topics such as AI and HCI, accessibility, and interface software tools. Students are expected to engage with multiple research papers weekly and complete a research project over the quarter. Prerequisites include specific courses for undergraduate and master's students in Computer Science and Symbolic Systems, while PhD students and those outside these fields have no prerequisites.\n\n4. **Music and AI (CS 470, MUSIC 356)**\n   - **Summary**: This \"critical making\" course focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and music creation. It addresses key questions about the implications of using AI in art, the balance between machine automation and human interaction, and the ethical considerations surrounding technology in creative processes. Students will learn practical skills for AI-mediated music creation, develop software systems that integrate AI and human-computer interaction, and engage in critical reflection on the aesthetic and ethical aspects of using technology in art.\n\n5. **Topics in Human-Computer Interaction: Teaching Studio Classes (CS 377T)**\n   - **Summary**: This course focuses on studio teaching, which has its roots in traditional art studios. It emphasizes teaching project-based classes that incorporate critique, effective coaching, project design, and material curation to enhance the flipped classroom experience. The course is particularly recommended for teaching assistants in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
