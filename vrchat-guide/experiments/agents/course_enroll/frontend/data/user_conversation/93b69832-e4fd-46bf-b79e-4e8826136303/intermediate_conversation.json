Here is the information about CS231N:\n\n- **Course Title:** Deep Learning for Computer Vision\n- **Course Codes:** CS 231N\n- **Description:** Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification and object detection. Recent developments in neural network approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision. During this course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. We will cover learning algorithms, neural network architectures, and practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning networks for visual recognition tasks.\n\nPrerequisites include proficiency in Python, college calculus, linear algebra, and basic probability and statistics.\n\nBased on this information, CS231N focuses on computer vision, which could be relevant for visual components of multi-modal LLMs. However, if your interest specifically pertains to multi-modal aspects, you might want to consider the specifics of CS230 as well or seek additional guidance on how these courses align with your goals.\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
