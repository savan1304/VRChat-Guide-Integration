        "bot": "I checked for easy programming courses in AI available during the winter. Here are some options I found:\n\n1. **Course Title**: Continuous Mathematical Methods with an Emphasis on Machine Learning  \n   **Course Codes**: CS 205L  \n   **Review Summary**: This course focuses on numerical methods and linear algebra with applications in graphics and AI. It requires a strong mathematical foundation and is described as rigorous but rewarding. Students find it valuable for building essential math skills for advanced AI courses, despite its difficulty.\n\n2. **Course Title**: Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques  \n   **Course Codes**: CS 228  \n   **Review Summary**: Taught by Professor Stefano, this challenging course is praised for its clarity and helpful teaching assistants. It covers probability and machine learning, but some find it less applicable to real-world problems. It is recommended for students with a strong math background interested in AI.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like more details on any of these courses or if you have other preferences. Could you also provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
