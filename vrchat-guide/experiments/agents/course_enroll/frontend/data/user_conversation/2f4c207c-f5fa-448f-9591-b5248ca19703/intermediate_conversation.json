It's noted for improving writing quality through grading practice. The class is low commitment but beneficial for presentation skills and conflict resolution, particularly in AI contexts. Overall, it\u2019s a great opportunity to gain valuable knowledge in a short time.\n\n2. **Value of Data and AI (CS 320)**:\n   - **Review Summary**: This course provides insights into data and AI from a less technical perspective, featuring talks from industry and academic experts. It's a relaxed course with a flexible project tailored to student interests, ideal for those with specific projects in mind. It offers a valuable learning experience about business applications of AI, despite suggestions for better organization and project guidelines.\n\n3. **AI-Assisted Care (CS 337, MED 277)**:\n   - **Review Summary**: Recommended for those interested in healthcare, this course provides valuable insights into healthcare-related research.\n\n4. **Computer Graphics in the Era of AI (CS 348I)**:\n   - **Review Summary**: This course focuses on deep learning applications in computer graphics. It's interactive and demanding, requiring significant effort in reading and presentations, fostering collaboration among students. It's highly recommended for its comprehensive overview of recent advancements in AI-driven graphics, despite suggestions for enhancing audience engagement and providing lecture materials in advance.\n\n5. **Seminar on AI Safety (CS 521)**:\n   - **Review Summary**: This seminar series focuses on AI safety, covering technical and ethical aspects. It's recommended for those with an advanced computer science background due to its technical content. The seminar features diverse speakers discussing various AI safety topics. While challenging for those without a strong AI background, it offers a valuable introduction to current research and issues in AI safety.\n\nPlease let me know if any of these courses interest you or if you need further assistance!",
