The course is project-focused on embedded systems, emphasizing the value of having a good idea and a strong team. It suggests that more communication between groups could enhance collaboration and learning. The workload is light, and the course is relevant to many areas of computer science. The professor provides guidance, but students are encouraged to take the initiative in developing their projects. Keeping group sizes small is recommended for better coordination. It is considered worthwhile for those with a strong project interest or a good team.\n\n2. This review highlights the friendly and helpful nature of the professors, Levis and Horowitz. The course involves significant project work, requiring more effort than typical 2-credit classes. It is officially listed as 3 credits but is actually 2 credits. The course offers a valuable learning experience but can be challenging due to unexpected problems. It requires a substantial time commitment outside of class but ultimately leads to a rewarding experience and a cool final project.\n\n3. A positive review of a course focused on creating a programmable light sculpture project at Stanford. The enjoyable and collaborative nature of the class is led by instructors Phil and Charlie. Students from various engineering backgrounds contribute to different aspects of the project. Having some knowledge of the C programming language is important for success. Overall, the course is described as a fun and valuable experience that fosters camaraderie among students.\n\n4. This review of the EE285 class highlights skills such as CAD, PCB design, soldering, and problem-solving in a supportive environment. The workload is manageable, and collaboration with teammates leads to a rewarding experience. The instructor, Phil, is praised for being communicative and ensuring that students learn while having fun. The class is highly recommended.\n\nCould you please provide me with the details of the courses you want to take?",
