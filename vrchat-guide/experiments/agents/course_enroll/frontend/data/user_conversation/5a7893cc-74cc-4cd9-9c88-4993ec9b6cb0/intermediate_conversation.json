It felt like every student was parrotting what the other students had previously said about other papers, since no one could really come up with *actionable* pros or cons.

Tatsu does a great job of providing a comprehensive overview of the field and all the different manifestations of domain shift. He selected very relevant papers that helped trace the development of the field from its early beginnings to the present day. The class is well organized around important themes and the emphasis on discussion ensures student participation both as a presenter and as a reviewer/questioner. I also really appreciated the small class size which is a refreshing change over the usual CS classes at Stanford. The class can emphasize the theory a bit more than regular AI classes at Stanford but it's manageable with spending some extra time with the papers.\", 'Highly recommend', \"The class does a very comprehensive job of going over cutting-edge research in about machine learning under distribution shifts. The lectures are clear and engaging, and the teaching staff are very friendly and available to answer questions and help students out. I'd highly recommend this class to anyone interested in working in machine learning, whether in research or in industry, since distribution shifts are an important part of many machine learning applications.\", \"It's a good survey of research on ML under distributional shift (2 papers a week and 1 lecture, 1 discussion per week). In order to understand the papers, CS 229M was helpful and I'd recommend taking that before this class (in general a stats/math background helpful for the denser papers).\", \"This is a novel but really interesting course. It would likely help to be familiar with the material in CS 229 and CS 234, and I think CS 330 also draws some interesting connections. Tatsu's a great lecturer and both him and the TAs were very accessible, and the discussions were fun as well. I imagine in person, the learning experience will be even more energized.\", \"I believe this class will get better over time. This was Tatsu's first time teaching the course and thus it could have used a bit more structure in the discussions. It felt like every student was parrotting what the other students had previously said about other papers, since no one could really come up with *actionable* pros or cons. I think having concrete discussion questions in the future will allow students to make progress in more creative/interesting directions that might lead to better research ideas.\", \"Great course, Tatsu is a wonderful professor! Highly recommend it as it is an area of ML that isn't touched upon much in other classes and will likely be one of the main problems of field moving forward in the future.\", 'A low-stress course that allows you to freely learn a lot -- clear, information-packed, and yet intuitive lectures + a great discussion structure.', 'Take it!
