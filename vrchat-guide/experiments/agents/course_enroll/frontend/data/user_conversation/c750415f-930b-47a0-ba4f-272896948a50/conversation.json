This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.  The videos and reading simply don't go into much detail but the exams expect you to have a deep level of understanding.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

They also invite a number of cool guest speakers from companies such as Google and Netflix, to talk about networking nuances that are relevant to their jobs.

You have to watch 3-4 hours of videos   quiz each week in addition to lecture. Programming assignments are fun!', \"TLDR: great but long assignments; an unorganized class which is surprising considering all the prepared material they give you; good lectures; very hard midterm; annoying unit videos; a lot of work but manageable if you know what you're getting yourself into.  This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way. Keith has a fun, engaging teaching style but can seem a bit condescending if you aren't prepared for his personality but I really liked him.   Lastly: the midterm was brutal.

The content was very interesting and the instruction was excellent. The course was a bit less forgiving than some of the core CS classes, but the staff were helpful and pretty receptive to feedback. The workload is generally alright (especially in comparison to 110), but there are certainly some weeks in the middle of the quarter when it'll occupy a lot of time and you'll find yourself spending around 6-7 hours a week on lectures/videos/quizzes, and perhaps another 10-15 on the assignments. That being said, the last few weeks are very relaxed and seeing the product of all your assignments come together for the final lab is very gratifying.\", \"A solid intro course in networking. Workload I would say ~12 hours/week (maybe a bit more if you study a lot for the midterm and final. the midterm was hard).

Things I didn't like: - The class is pretty disorganized. There are three components: online videos, live lecture, and lab assignments. The online videos are not great. Most of them are from 2013 and while they're detailed, I don't see why this couldn't be transferred to live lectures. Most of the time, the live lectures just repeat what's said in the online videos.  - The content is nonlinear. For example, Unit 6 (physical layer) deviates completely from the previous units and was pretty confusing.  - The guest lectures are not super useful.\", \"Of the systems track courses, this is the easiest.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

There's a lot of interesting material they cover and the teaching staff all seem really enthusiastic about helping students learn more about networking. Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

Lectures are mandatory (flipped classroom), but they cover a subset of the material that was covered in the online videos. You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done. Midterm kinda sucked, it was waaaaay too long and didn't have any programming questions, just math, multiple choice, and short answer. Average was around 60, but not because it was hard, only because it was too long, which I think constitutes bad exam design.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way.

For everything we cover, they always provide background information and reasoning as to why things are the way they are, and they fill the class with stories from their own personal experiences working with the internet.  If you take this class, be sure to start as early as possible on the labs; since they involve implementing real network protocols which can talk to other computers across the real internet, you do need to read the lab specifications carefully, and often will need to ask questions to ensure that your understanding of the specification matches the rest of the worlds' understanding.

During remote, they had lab sessions at 6pm PT when a lot of people couldn't attend due to timezones.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way. Keith has a fun, engaging teaching style but can seem a bit condescending if you aren't prepared for his personality but I really liked him.   Lastly: the midterm was brutal. It was as long as a final exam, no joke. Why kill our spirits like that, dear professors?\", 'Great course to learn about the architecture and protocols of the internet today. However, the flipped classroom set up means you spend a lot of time watching videos on your own to understand the concepts and the lectures are not particularly helpful.

It's also really, really interesting to learn about how the internet works. I wish I took this before cs155 so that I would've understood that class better.\", \"CS144 is a good class.   Things I liked: - Keith W. is an amazing lecturer, if you have an opportunity to take a class with him, do it! - The lab assignments are well structured and well put together. The development was pretty enjoyable.  - The content of the course is pretty relevant and important. You walk away with a really thorough understanding of the internet, particularly TCP.  Things I didn't like: - The class is pretty disorganized. There are three components: online videos, live lecture, and lab assignments. The online videos are not great. Most of them are from 2013 and while they're detailed, I don't see why this couldn't be transferred to live lectures. Most of the time, the live lectures just repeat what's said in the online videos.  - The content is nonlinear. For example, Unit 6 (physical layer) deviates completely from the previous units and was pretty confusing.  - The guest lectures are not super useful.\", \"Of the systems track courses, this is the easiest. CS140 is death. CS143 is a grind. CS144 is a stroll in Central Park with a freshly brewed cup of coffee in one hand and the Wall Street Journal in the other.

Now I do. That's pretty cool and certainly important\", 'The labs are interesting and neat, but a little too \"on rails\". There is less flailing around having no idea what to do (compared to 140). Labs can be completed just from their documentation. Lectures are completely skippable, I went to maybe 2 or 3. I opened up all the slides and that was enough to complete the midetrm & final with no difficulty.', 'This class has given me a solid understanding of the internet and networking. I believe this will be very valuable throughout my career as a software engineer as networking backs a lot of infrastructure and services. The TCP/network interface labs Keith created are superb. It is great to have an opportunity to work with C  . The recorded lectures make this class very convenient and allows students to choose which subjects to invest more time in - I really appreciated this.', \"A fantastic course. Keith and Nick are really great teachers, and the homework assignments are really fun. It's super cool when you reach the end and have a fully functioning router and TCP end host. The workload may seem a little daunting at first with weeklyish assignments, but the homework is often fairly short (some are like 25 lines of code) and there's an on time bonus for a lot of them. If you do the homework on time, you'll be in good shape gradewise. The tests are a little tricky and time sensitive, but they're very fair and interesting.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

In general the programming assignments are well put together.

There's a lot of interesting material they cover and the teaching staff all seem really enthusiastic about helping students learn more about networking. Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

Lectures are mandatory (flipped classroom), but they cover a subset of the material that was covered in the online videos. You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done. Midterm kinda sucked, it was waaaaay too long and didn't have any programming questions, just math, multiple choice, and short answer. Average was around 60, but not because it was hard, only because it was too long, which I think constitutes bad exam design.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way.

For everything we cover, they always provide background information and reasoning as to why things are the way they are, and they fill the class with stories from their own personal experiences working with the internet.  If you take this class, be sure to start as early as possible on the labs; since they involve implementing real network protocols which can talk to other computers across the real internet, you do need to read the lab specifications carefully, and often will need to ask questions to ensure that your understanding of the specification matches the rest of the worlds' understanding.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support! There's a lot to get out of this class if you put in the work and use all of the resources 144 offers.\", 'Really amazing class.', \"Professor Winstein is very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. The lectures have a ton of content and don't slow down, but he is approachable and encouraged questions if you need help understanding a topic.

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.  The videos and reading simply don't go into much detail but the exams expect you to have a deep level of understanding.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

You have to watch 3-4 hours of videos   quiz each week in addition to lecture. Programming assignments are fun!', \"TLDR: great but long assignments; an unorganized class which is surprising considering all the prepared material they give you; good lectures; very hard midterm; annoying unit videos; a lot of work but manageable if you know what you're getting yourself into.  This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

Assignments don't take a lot of time if you're pretty proficient in C++ and read the assignment specs carefully.

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

In general the programming assignments are well put together.

That's so much to keep up with, and it's really easy for stuff to get lost/forgotten/slip through the cracks when they expect you to know it.\", 'This is a great class. I will say I really, really did not enjoy the flipped classroom structure... There are a ton of videos to watch every week, and then lecture ends up repeating most of the same content, such that it feels pointless to watch the videos (but then the exams test on nuances that might have been covered in the videos but not in person so I get FOMO and have to watch everything anyways).

There's a lot of interesting material they cover and the teaching staff all seem really enthusiastic about helping students learn more about networking. Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning. Which sucks. I think I stopped learning anything like halfway through, at which point it just became \"oh. I missed this edge case. great.\"', 'Lab 3 is pretty frustrating.

Additionally, the midterm, while doable with sufficient independent studying, was quite unlike any of the problems we had done in class or for the flipped classroom comprehension quizzes.  I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code. I would also inform students that the assignments do not cover networking at the application layer but just focus on how some of the underlying protocols of the internet work.

Lectures are mandatory (flipped classroom), but they cover a subset of the material that was covered in the online videos. You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done. Midterm kinda sucked, it was waaaaay too long and didn't have any programming questions, just math, multiple choice, and short answer. Average was around 60, but not because it was hard, only because it was too long, which I think constitutes bad exam design.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way. Keith has a fun, engaging teaching style but can seem a bit condescending if you aren't prepared for his personality but I really liked him.   Lastly: the midterm was brutal.

For everything we cover, they always provide background information and reasoning as to why things are the way they are, and they fill the class with stories from their own personal experiences working with the internet.  If you take this class, be sure to start as early as possible on the labs; since they involve implementing real network protocols which can talk to other computers across the real internet, you do need to read the lab specifications carefully, and often will need to ask questions to ensure that your understanding of the specification matches the rest of the worlds' understanding.

Each lab comes with a fairly comprehensive test suite to help with this but no test suite can catch everything.

During remote, they had lab sessions at 6pm PT when a lot of people couldn't attend due to timezones. They also were inflexible regarding exams by disregarding individual's situations and circumstances.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support! There's a lot to get out of this class if you put in the work and use all of the resources 144 offers.\", 'Really amazing class.', \"Professor Winstein is very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. The lectures have a ton of content and don't slow down, but he is approachable and encouraged questions if you need help understanding a topic.

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.  The videos and reading simply don't go into much detail but the exams expect you to have a deep level of understanding.  After the final we found out that this wasn't an accident it's some ridiculous pedagogical method being done intentionally!  There were some positives.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

Assignments don't take a lot of time if you're pretty proficient in C++ and read the assignment specs carefully.

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.

However, the class has some annoying structural flaws, namely in that the online video lectures and in class lectures combined make up a LOT of content - effectively 6 hours of content a week. That's so much to keep up with, and it's really easy for stuff to get lost/forgotten/slip through the cracks when they expect you to know it.\", 'This is a great class. I will say I really, really did not enjoy the flipped classroom structure... There are a ton of videos to watch every week, and then lecture ends up repeating most of the same content, such that it feels pointless to watch the videos (but then the exams test on nuances that might have been covered in the videos but not in person so I get FOMO and have to watch everything anyways). However, the in-person lectures were engaging, and the guest talks were interesting, and I thought the programming assignments were super cool (you basically get to build a small portion of the internet).', 'Great class, start the assignments early', 'You definitely learn a lot from the class. There's a lot of interesting material they cover and the teaching staff all seem really enthusiastic about helping students learn more about networking. Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning. Which sucks. I think I stopped learning anything like halfway through, at which point it just became \"oh. I missed this edge case. great.\"', 'Lab 3 is pretty frustrating.

We only had a handful of guest lectures throughout the quarter. Additionally, the midterm, while doable with sufficient independent studying, was quite unlike any of the problems we had done in class or for the flipped classroom comprehension quizzes.  I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code. I would also inform students that the assignments do not cover networking at the application layer but just focus on how some of the underlying protocols of the internet work.  Overall, I felt that this course discussed important material but was very poorly taught.', \"I found the class really interesting.

However, I frequently found the material uninteresting, often delving into low-level details that didn't seem important to me. I wasn't sure if I just didn't understand what was important or not, but it sometimes seemed like the instructors (mostly in the weekly videos) were teaching what was interesting to them rather than what was most relevant/useful.\", \"A pretty meh/bad class. Lectures are mandatory (flipped classroom), but they cover a subset of the material that was covered in the online videos. You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done. Midterm kinda sucked, it was waaaaay too long and didn't have any programming questions, just math, multiple choice, and short answer. Average was around 60, but not because it was hard, only because it was too long, which I think constitutes bad exam design. Overall, would not recommend since you can just watch the online videos in about 3 hours and get all the important stuff, given that the programming assignments weren't that helpful.\", \"If you're interested in learning about the internet, take it.

They also invite a number of cool guest speakers from companies such as Google and Netflix, to talk about networking nuances that are relevant to their jobs. As a disclaimer, the class is fairly time consuming.

You have to watch 3-4 hours of videos   quiz each week in addition to lecture. Programming assignments are fun!', \"TLDR: great but long assignments; an unorganized class which is surprising considering all the prepared material they give you; good lectures; very hard midterm; annoying unit videos; a lot of work but manageable if you know what you're getting yourself into.  This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way. Keith has a fun, engaging teaching style but can seem a bit condescending if you aren't prepared for his personality but I really liked him.   Lastly: the midterm was brutal.

Most of them are from 2013 and while they're detailed, I don't see why this couldn't be transferred to live lectures.

Workload is reasonable and the labs can be quite fun...you end up building a full TCP networking stack by the end of the course. But be aware that labs are cumulative so any undiscovered bugs may come back to bite later on. Each lab comes with a fairly comprehensive test suite to help with this but no test suite can catch everything.  Course is taught in C   but the labs don't generally require knowledge of any advanced C   features. If you can pick up the basics quickly and have a solid programming foundation, that is probably enough to do the labs.\", \"I stumbled upon CS 144 by chance and am extremely grateful that I did so! I never realized just how little I knew about how the Internet works until I took this class. It was extremely satisfying to build my own TCP connection and network interface capable of communicating with others across the Internet, and the course is extremely well-organized and well-explained. There is a fair bit more math in this class than other systems classes I've taken, which I personally enjoyed.

I feel like I learned a lot. I really enjoyed Nick's lectures and his module videos. I grew on Keith's lecturing style towards the end, but sometimes his style was confusing (particularly with the window size lectures). My only other comment is that the class is extremely inflexible. During remote, they had lab sessions at 6pm PT when a lot of people couldn't attend due to timezones. They also were inflexible regarding exams by disregarding individual's situations and circumstances. But, besides that, they teach the class really well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the class.\", \"This course is not bad, but it can be improved.

If you do the homework on time, you'll be in good shape gradewise. The tests are a little tricky and time sensitive, but they're very fair and interesting.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support! There's a lot to get out of this class if you put in the work and use all of the resources 144 offers.\", 'Really amazing class.', \"Professor Winstein is very knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. The lectures have a ton of content and don't slow down, but he is approachable and encouraged questions if you need help understanding a topic. Since most of the material of this course are protocols created in the 20th century, lectures can include lengthy explanations of historical situations/approaches, but the overall content is still foundational to the internet and used today: you'll learn about things that your web browser/home router/Netflix actually do. The labs are lengthy and can be difficult to debug, and the specs don't tell you exactly what to do. Start early so that you can attend the lab sessions and the most helpful CAs' office hours if you get stuck.\", 'TAKE THIS CLASS!!!

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.  The videos and reading simply don't go into much detail but the exams expect you to have a deep level of understanding.

Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

The lectures have a ton of content and don't slow down, but he is approachable and encouraged questions if you need help understanding a topic.

However, his attitude towards covid was a bit concerning \u2013xa0the first day of class, he spent a while playing a video that poked fun of post-covid socialization, and even after we had an outbreak of 5 cases over a couple of days, he still seemed quite adamant on continuing in-person lectures. It's also unfortunate that participation is 15% of the grade in a >100 person class like this that doesn't have sections or official attendance-taking \u2013xa0it's unclear what the standard is for full participation credit.

Can't recommend enough.\", \"Keith is such an awesome professor. He lectures with great enthusiasm and gives very intuitive examples. Him and his teaching staff are equipped to handle many questions you struggle to even think of. This is an enlightening, yet -quite- hefty class.

Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

Some of the guest lectures were pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing to take away is that you learn alot. I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code. I would also inform students that the assignments do not cover networking at the application layer but just focus on how some of the underlying protocols of the internet work.

Lectures are mandatory (flipped classroom), but they cover a subset of the material that was covered in the online videos. You need to watch videos every week and take quizzes on the videos, and then go to lecture and hear the same material repeated in lecture, but in less detail. Video quizzes were kind of hard too. Assignments were pretty meh too, since they essentially boiled down to reading RFCs and implementing what they said in the documentation word-for-word. Without many opportunities for design, the assignments weren't that useful. They took a while to finish considering the amount of learning that was done. Midterm kinda sucked, it was waaaaay too long and didn't have any programming questions, just math, multiple choice, and short answer. Average was around 60, but not because it was hard, only because it was too long, which I think constitutes bad exam design.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way.

If you take this class, be sure to start as early as possible on the labs; since they involve implementing real network protocols which can talk to other computers across the real internet, you do need to read the lab specifications carefully, and often will need to ask questions to ensure that your understanding of the specification matches the rest of the worlds' understanding.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

This class isn't quite that bad but it comes close.  This course is a team taught flipped classroom.  Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.  In addition to the above, there are 5 programming assignments in C that build on each other.  This means if you don't get one of them working it will come back to haunt you.  In general the programming assignments are well put together.  The time estimates given are way off though, expect to spend 3-4x because the test suite that is provided with the starter code is incomplete and you'll need to build your own that has the missing test cases in addition to writing documentation if you want to receive full credit.  The assignments are graded on style but repeated requests for a style guide were rebuffed.  There is a midterm and a final exam.  Prepare to be blindsided by the exams.  There is as serious disconnect between the exams and the other parts of the course.  The quizzes that go with the videos and the sample exams WILL NOT prepare you.  The videos and reading simply don't go into much detail but the exams expect you to have a deep level of understanding.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

Nick and Keith are fun lectures who do an excellent job making class an interactive experience. They also invite a number of cool guest speakers from companies such as Google and Netflix, to talk about networking nuances that are relevant to their jobs. As a disclaimer, the class is fairly time consuming. Start early on the programming projects, as they require implementing complex protocols and ensuring that your code addresses every edge case requires substantial testing (which is honestly quite tedious). Overall, this course is arguably a must-take for any Stanford computer scientist.', 'Definitely one of the more substantial coding classes at Stanford, but also very rewarding. Would recommend taking if you have any interest in how the Internet works', \"This class is a lot of work and it's a bit scattered in that there are a lot of things to juggle each week (lab assignments, mandatory lectures, online videos, etc.). I learned a lot and found most of the material interesting, but don't underestimate the amount of work this class is.\", 'Course is just ok. You have to watch 3-4 hours of videos   quiz each week in addition to lecture. Programming assignments are fun!', \"TLDR: great but long assignments; an unorganized class which is surprising considering all the prepared material they give you; good lectures; very hard midterm; annoying unit videos; a lot of work but manageable if you know what you're getting yourself into.  This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.  The TAs are generally helpful. Nick is awesome: brilliant in a calm, confident kind of way. Keith has a fun, engaging teaching style but can seem a bit condescending if you aren't prepared for his personality but I really liked him.   Lastly: the midterm was brutal. It was as long as a final exam, no joke. Why kill our spirits like that, dear professors?\", 'Great course to learn about the architecture and protocols of the internet today. However, the flipped classroom set up means you spend a lot of time watching videos on your own to understand the concepts and the lectures are not particularly helpful.

The content was very interesting and the instruction was excellent. The course was a bit less forgiving than some of the core CS classes, but the staff were helpful and pretty receptive to feedback. The workload is generally alright (especially in comparison to 110), but there are certainly some weeks in the middle of the quarter when it'll occupy a lot of time and you'll find yourself spending around 6-7 hours a week on lectures/videos/quizzes, and perhaps another 10-15 on the assignments.

Things I didn't like: - The class is pretty disorganized. There are three components: online videos, live lecture, and lab assignments. The online videos are not great. Most of them are from 2013 and while they're detailed, I don't see why this couldn't be transferred to live lectures. Most of the time, the live lectures just repeat what's said in the online videos.  - The content is nonlinear. For example, Unit 6 (physical layer) deviates completely from the previous units and was pretty confusing.  - The guest lectures are not super useful.\", \"Of the systems track courses, this is the easiest.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!

However, his attitude towards covid was a bit concerning \u2013xa0the first day of class, he spent a while playing a video that poked fun of post-covid socialization, and even after we had an outbreak of 5 cases over a couple of days, he still seemed quite adamant on continuing in-person lectures. It's also unfortunate that participation is 15% of the grade in a >100 person class like this that doesn't have sections or official attendance-taking \u2013xa0it's unclear what the standard is for full participation credit.

Each week you are required to watch 2-3 hours of videos (recorded 5 years ago), complete a quiz, do textbook readings, and attend a required lecture which is either a guest speaker or an exercise.  The videos cover a lot of topics without much depth and there's no indication of what is important and what is not, which tends to make it hard to learn.  Many of the videos have a super annoying hum, like they were recorded using the internal mic on a laptop.  This might be acceptable for a MOOC that's being given away for free, but we are paying tuition and should have professional quality production.  The professors need to stop being lazy and go back to giving traditional lectures or hire a production team to produce high quality videos.

In general the programming assignments are well put together.

I'm honestly surprised looking back on the class just how much more I know about the internals of networking and it's definitely helped me appreciate just how complex the internet can be.  Onto what I wasn't a huge fan of (mostly administrative stuff): - It sometimes feels more like the teaching staff blasts you with just a firehose of different material in multiple different formats (lectures, lecture videos, online quizzes, assignments, RFC citations, Piazza comments, lab notes, etc.) and you just kind of have to hope you got everything. It's a lot of work just keeping track of everything they talk about because there's just so much to cover in so little time. - It was really time-consuming trying to slog through all the content. Lectures are mandatory, but many lectures cover much of the same content as the online videos, which are also mandatory due to quizzes after each unit. Why have both? It just seems like time wasted either for everyone at lecture, or the students watching videos of content covered in class. The class didn't seem to take advantage of the flipped classroom format much. Only one lecture was spent doing some sort of lab, and everything else was just more lectures often covering similar material. - Grading took a decently long amount of time. I guess this is understandable due to how few TAs there seemed to be compared to the number of people taking the class. - Unit quizzes due on Monday at 3pm(?). Like, why? Why not just make it midnight? Trying to remember when unit quizzes were due honestly probably caused me more stress and lost points in the class than the assignments. Probably mostly my fault, but seriously? Why? - Midterm structure seemed to not match with the course material, with how it seemed to focus a select few topics out of the vast array of material covered in the 4-6 weeks prior, seemingly more focused on trying to identify what sort of arithmetic and quantitative problems they could throw at us over any sort of broad conceptual understanding of the material being covered, which would seem more appropriate for a class that I would describe as a \"conceptual firehose\". - Assignment 3 honestly seemed more about constructing as many if-statements to account for all the possible edge cases than any sort of conceptual learning.

I found the assignments to be underwhelming and disjoint from other aspects of the course. We only completed 3 actual programming assignments over the entire quarter, the second of which was a moderate extension of the first. While implementing a simplified TCP implementation and an IP router was good for building my understanding of these protocols, many of the interesting/challenging aspects in building these programs (especially for the router) were already implemented for us in the starter code.

This class is essential in the sense that it covers an important field that I think every CS major should know about. That being said, I do have issues with the way the class is organized.  There are unit videos (2-3 hours' worth per week) that you have to watch every week followed by a quiz to test you on that unit's material. In addition, there are lectures. While I do find the quiz questions extremely useful, they unfortunately don't correspond to what you end up seeing on the midterm. Also, it is a HUGE time commitment to watch the unit videos AND the lecture videos each week in my opinion. The material in lectures versus in unit videos isn't always taught the same way. There's also some other random person with Nick in the videos who is explaining concepts, and that person is not the other co-professor in the actual class (Keith is). So you end up with three people explaining concepts which can be, as you'd imagine, all over the place teaching style-wise.  I think the course would be better if they revamped/remade the unit videos and then took questions in class about the videos/concepts, OR got rid of the videos altogether and focused more on quizzing us on the reading material and having solid lectures and fewer guest speakers.  My issue with the reading material: oftentimes the reading didn't actually correspond to the unit videos/lectures. Sometimes we saw things in the videos that were not in that week's reading, or we read things that weren't covered in the videos until weeks later. This was THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING. I even noticed that the videos would cover material that wasn't assigned reading at ALL during the quarter, and often found myself doing more than the assigned reading just to get a better understanding of what was discussed.  I will say that the assignments are, in my opinion, great. They teach you a LOT about networking concepts and how to actually implement them. The assignments were in C again this quarter which honestly didn't bother me at all (I love C), but they are time-consuming and with all the videos and reading, the biggest challenge was just finding the time to get the assignments done.

To qualify: this course has a pretty hard cs110 prereq, but I took it concurrently with 110 & had taken a couple harder CS classes before this.  First, the negatives / things to watch for.  Perhaps I had less programming maturity than expected, but I found most of the labs 0 to 4 to be ~hard~, time-consuming, and a non-trivial amount of time to debug last-mile edge cases.  The labs are cumulative, and you ~really~ need your first labs to be bulletproof, so 100% functionality is demanded from each assignment.  This practically meant that I would spend more time debugging the hardest last 10% of functionality as i took to write the prior 90%.   I got better at the style of class-based, meticulous c++ programming this course demands with time, but lab0, lab1 were especially hard for me.  Putting the labs together for lab4 ended up taking untold amounts of time, as this practically meant I had to modify every prior lab to fix small latent bugs that weren't caught by the test harness in order to pass a final battery of 165 test cases, and then more time to optimize my code to pass a throughput requirement.  This may sound negative at first, but I actually quite enjoyed working on these labs apart from debugging the trickiest test cases.  If you compare 110 to this course, these are proper, serious assignments with much less support from TAs and Ed. You'll learn to handle ambiguity in hard assignments that test your ability to write precise, robust code. And you'll be able to tell your friends you basically built the entire internet from scratch-- because you almost did!  It's great to look back and see all the cool and important pieces you built over the course of 10 weeks-- a robust TCP, network interface, and router that packages and sends real traffic over the internet!  So overall, I would recommend the course-- just know what you're signing up for, and give yourself plenty of extra time, especially if you may have a bit less of the expected background coming in.  Finally, go to lab sessions to meet people and make friends! Your life will be much better.\", 'Class is almost entirely about TCP and so nothing you learn is modern. Good for learning about foundations, though a bunch of material is covered in a very shallow way. Workload is manageable.', \"144 was a challenge for me, and there were many times I felt overwhelmed and didn't feel like I belonged in the class. Since the project is due at the end of the quarter, it's easy to fall behind and I definitely fell very far behind. But, the support of the teaching team really made ALL the difference in finishing the class, and implementing TCP has really stretched my coding skills, debugging skills, and C++ skills. I felt like I dove deep into the topic of Networking and came out of the class with a deep understanding of how the Internet works. This came from spending hours debugging my different modules of TCP, helping other students with their labs, and reading the many in-depth explanations on the discussion forum. So I'd say go to the lab sessions! Meet people there and form a study group! Go to office hours and reach out to the teaching team if you need more support!
