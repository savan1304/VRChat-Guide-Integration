However, there are growing concerns about the negative aspects of NLP systems, such as biases and a lack of input from users. This course gives an overview of human-centered techniques and applications for NLP, ranging from human-centered design thinking to human-in-the-loop algorithms, fairness, and accessibility. Along the way, we will cover machine-learning techniques which are especially relevant to NLP and to human experiences.
